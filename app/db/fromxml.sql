Preserving and protecting healthy trees can help the City to achieve these goals. Considering tree protection in the initial stages of construction planning may mean the difference between preserving a healthy tree and having to remove it. Plans created with tree protection in mind help protect the city\'s urban forest. \r\nThe tree protection policy and specifications outlined below reflect the policy of Toronto City Council. Anyone failing to adhere to the tree protection polic y and specifications will be financially responsible for any resulting damage to trees and may be charged under the provisions of the applicable City of Toronto tree by-law or subject to orders to comply. \r\nPr\r\nior to commencing with any demolition or construction activity it is important that an arborist\r\n1 determines the location, species, size and condition of trees on the property and surrounding properties and becomes familiar with the tree protection by-laws that could impact the proposal. \r\nThe following by-laws protect trees in the City of Toronto: \r\n•Street Tree By-law\r\n, City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 813, Article II, protects all\r\ntrees situated on City streets.\r\n•Private Tree By-law , Article III, Chapter 813 of the City of Toronto Municipal Code\r\nprotects trees on private property with diameter of 30cm or more and trees of anydiameter that were planted as a condition of a permit  issued under this bylaw or a site plan agreement.\r\n•The Ravine & Natural Feature Protection By-law, Chapter 658 of the City of Toronto\r\nMunicipal Code prohibits and regulates the injury and destruction of trees, as well as filling, grading and dumping within designated areas of the City.  There is no minimum diameter for a tree to qualify for protection under the Ravine and Natural FeatureProtection By-law. Trees of any size located in the designated areas qualify  for protection.•The Parks By-law\r\n, Municipal Code Chapter 608, Article VII protects all trees located in\r\na City park.\r\nAll above noted by-laws are implemented by Urban Forestry under the authority of the General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation. City of Toronto\'s tree protection by-laws can be found at www.toronto.ca/trees\r\n. \r\nTypes of Tree Damage \r\nPhysical injury to the trunk, crown and roots of a tree will occur if construction equipment is permitted close to trees or if structures are built into the growing space of a tree. Inappropriate pruning may also result in tree injury. Physical injuries are permanent and can be fatal.  \r\n1 Arborist – An expert in the care and maintenance of trees including an arborist qualified by the Ontario Training and Adjustment Board Apprenticeship and Client Services Branch, a certified arborist qualified by the International Society of Arboriculture, a consulting arborist registered with the American Society of Consulting Arborists, a registered professional forester or a person with other similar qualifications as approved by the General Manager, Parks, Forestry and Recreation.  \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n3\r\nRoot cutting is another type of physical injury that can significantly impact the health of a tree. The majority of tree roots are found in the upper 30 to 60 cm of soil. Excavation for foundations or utility installation may cut roots if the excavation is too close to trees. Trees can become destabilized and may fall over if anchor roots are severed.  \r\nCompaction of the soil in the tree root zone is one of the leading causes of tree decline in Toronto’s urban forest. Soil compaction occurs primarily from vehicles and eq uipment moving across the root zones. Piling or storing materials or debris on top of the root system can also result in soil compaction. Soil compaction causes the pore spaces in the soil, which contains air and water necessary for root growth, to be reduced. Without space available for oxygen and water, tree roots will suffocate and tree decline will follow. With rutting, a form of intense compaction, roots are severed by the tires of equipment. Root destruction can also be caused by changes to the existing grade. Adding soil on top of tree roots can smother them by reducing the amount of oxygen and water they can receive. Only a few centimetres of added soil can have a detrimental impact on tree health. \r\nThe s\r\ntructural elements of a tree in an optimal growing environment are shown on Figure 1. This figure illustrates the terms used in this policy. \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n4\r\nFigure 1: Urban Forestry Detail TP-3 \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n5\r\n2.Protecting Trees\r\nThere are a number of steps that can be taken to protect trees prior to, during and after any construction project. Hiring an arborist should be the first step. An arborist can advise on current tree maintenance requirements and determine the impact the proposal will have on trees and the surrounding natural environment.  \r\nAn inventory of trees on subject and adjacent properties that may be impacted by the proposed work should be prepared in accordance with the City tree by-laws so that the project can be designed with tree protection in mind. A tree protection plan prepared by an arborist will identify the location, species, size and condition of all trees within the area of consideration, identify the extent of injury where applicable and outline proposed tree protection measures for the trees identified for protection.  \r\nTh\r\ne area of consideration for trees protected under the Private Tree By-law (Municipal Code, Chapter 813, Article III) includes the entire area of site disturbance, including construction related traffic and material storage, and extends 6m beyond the limit of site disturbance. For trees protected under Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By -law (Municipal Code, Chapter 658), the area of consideration includes the area of site disturbance and 12m area beyond.  \r\nThe\r\n following chart provides the required distances for determining a minimum tree protection zone (TPZ) for trees located on a City street, in parks and on private property subject to Private Tree By-law  and for trees located in areas regulated under the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-law. The minimum tree protection zones are based on the diameter of the tree. While these guidelines provide minimum protection distances for the anchor and transport roots of a tree, there can still be significant loss of the feeder roots beyond the established tree protection zone.  Feeder roots are responsible for water and nutrient absorption and gas exchange.  For this reason, Urban Forestry may require a TPZ larger than the minimum, depending on the tree and the surrounding environment.  \r\nTrunk Diameter  \r\n(DBH)1 Minimum Protection Distances \r\nRequired2 \r\nCity-owned and Private Trees Minimum Protection Distances \r\nRequired \r\nTrees in Areas Protected by the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-law \r\nWhichever of the two is greater : \r\n<10cm  1.2 m  The drip line4 or 1.2 m  \r\n10- 29 cm  1.8 m  The drip line or 3.6 m  \r\n303 – 40 cm  2.4 m  The drip line or 4.8 m  \r\n41 – 50 cm  3.0 m  The drip line or 6.0 m  \r\n51 – 60 cm  3.6 m  The drip line or 7.2 m  \r\n61 – 70cm  4.2 m  The drip line or 8.4 m  \r\n71 – 80cm  4.8 m  The drip line or 9.6 m  \r\n81 – 90 cm  5.4 m  The drip line or 10.8 m  \r\n91 – 100 cm  6.0 m  The drip line or 12.0 m  \r\n>100 cm  6 cm protection for each 1 cm \r\ndiameter  12cm protection for each 1 cm \r\ndiameter or the drip line5 \r\nTable 1: Minimum Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) Determination  \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n6\r\n1Diameter at breast height (DBH) measurement of tree stem taken at 1.4 metres  (m) above the ground. \r\n2MinimumTree Protection Zone distances are to be measured from the outside edge of the tree base. \r\n3Diameter (30 cm) at which trees qualify for protection under the Private Tree By-law. \r\n4The drip line is defined as the area beneath the outer most branch tips of a tree.  \r\n5Converted from ISA Arborists’ Certification Study Guide, general guideline for tree protection barriers of 1 foot of diameter from the stem for each inch of stem diameter.  \r\nThe diagram below shows how the TPZ is determined: \r\nFigure 2: Minimum Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) Determination  \r\nIn some cases, disturbances in the TPZ may be unavoidable, in which case, the TPZ must be adjusted in consultation with the arborist and Urban Forestry. In these situations, it may be necessary to implement other tree protection measures such as horizontal root protection  as noted in section 3 of this document. \r\nIn addition to establishing and creating tree protection zones, it may be necessary to implement other protective measures, such as adding mulch to the root zone, aeration of the soil, pruning for deadwood or removing limbs that may be impacted by construction activity. This is also the time to determine the location where new trees can be planted to complim ent the construction project and help with the renewal and growth of the urban forest.  \r\nPr\r\nior to commencing with any excavation, roots approved for pruning by Urban Forestry must first be exposed using pneumatic (air) excavation, by hand digging or by using a low pressure hydraulic (water) excavation. This exploratory excavation must be undertaken by an experienced operator under the supervision of a qualified and experienced arborist. The water pressure for hydraulic excavation must be low enough that root bark is not damaged or \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n7\r\nremoved. This will allow a proper pruning cut and minimize tearing of the roots. The arborist retained to carry out root pruning must contact Urban Forestry no less than three (3) working days prior to conducting any specified work.  \r\nExploratory excavation may also be required for open face cuts outside the minimum tree protection zone (TPZ). \r\nCommunication between owners and their designated agents, arborists,  contractors and sub- contractors throughout the construction process is critical to ensure that everyone involved is aware of the issues surrounding tree protection, and fully understands the tree protection methodology. Construction damage to trees is often irreversible. \r\nProhibited Activities Within a TPZ \r\nExcept where authorized by Urban Forestry, any activity which could result in injury or destruction of a protected tree or natural feature, or alteration of grade within a Ravine and Natural Feature Protection (RNFP) area, is prohibited within a TPZ, including, but not limited to, any of the following examples: \r\n•demolition, construction, replacement or alteration of permanent or temporary buildings orstructures, parking pads, driveways, sidewalks, walkways, paths, trails, dog runs, pools,retaining walls, patios, decks, terraces, sheds or raised gardens•installation of large stones or boulders•altering grade by adding or removing soil or fill, excavating, trenching, topsoil or fill scraping, compacting soil or fill, dumping or disturbance of any kind•storage of construction materials, equipment, wood, branches, leaves, soil or fill,construction waste or debris of any sort•application, discharge or disposal of any substance or chemical that may adversely affectthe health of a tree  e.g. concrete sluice, gas, oil, paint, pool water or backwash water from a swimming pool•causing or allowing water or discharge, to flow over slopes or through natural areas•access, parking or movement of vehicles, equipment or pedestrians•cutting, breaking, tearing, crushing, exposing or stripping tree\'s roots, trunk and branches.•nailing or stapling into a tree, including attachment of fences, electrical wires or signs•stringing of cables or installing lights on trees•soil remediation, removal of contaminated fill•excavating for directional or micro-tunnelling and boring entering shafts\r\nThe\r\n above mentioned prohibitions are for area(s) designated as a TPZ.  If possible, these prohibitions should also be implemented outside the TPZ in areas where tree roots are located. The roots of a tree can extend from the trunk to approximately 2-3 times the distance of the dripline.  \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n8\r\n3.Tree and Site Protection Measures\r\nThe following are examples of specific tree and site protection measures that may be required by Urban Forestry:  \r\n•Plywood tree protection hoarding (minimum 19mm or ¾\"), or equivalent barriers, as approved by Urban Forestry, shall be installed in locations as detailed in an Urban Forestryapproved Tree Protection Plan. Tree protection barriers must be made of 2.4m (8ft) highplywood hoarding or equivalent as approved by Urban Forestry. Height o f hoarding may be less than 2.4m (8ft), to accommodate tree branches that may be lower, or as approved byUrban Forestry. Within a City road allowance where visibility is a consideration, 1.2m ( 4ft) high orange plastic web snow fencing on a 38 x 89mm (2”x 4”) frame should be used. The detail on tree protection barrier construction is shown on Figure 4 in section 7 of thisdocument•In specific situations where the required full minimum tree protection zone (TPZ) cannot be provided, a horizontal (on grade) root protection, designed by a qualified professionalsuch as arborist or landscape architect, may be considered, subject to approval by UrbanForestry. Urban Forestry\'s objective is zero soil compaction within the tree protection zone, therefore best efforts must be made to achieve this objective using materials and bestpractices available that minimize the vertical loading and spread the loading horizontally .•Any area designated for stockpiling of excavated soil must be outside of TPZs and beenclosed with sediment control fencing. Sediment control fencing shall be installed in thelocations as indicated in an Urban Forestry approved Tree Protection Plan. The s ediment control fencing must be installed to Ontario Provincial Standards (OPSD -219.130 – see Section 7, Figure 5) and to the satisfaction of Urban Forestry. When feasible, the sediment control fencing can be attached to the tree protection barrier as show n in Figure 6. Sediment control fencing near trees shall be constructed as per detail shown on F igure 6 of this document\r\n4.Tree Protection Signage\r\nParks, Forestry & Recreation \r\nTree Protection Zone (TPZ) \r\nAll construction related activities, including  grade alteration, excavation, \r\nsoil compaction, any materials or equipment storage, disposal of liquid \r\nand vehicular traffic are NOT permitted within this TPZ.  \r\nThis tree protection barrier must remain in good condition and must not \r\nbe removed or altered without authorization of City of Toronto, Urban \r\nForestry. \r\nConcerns or inquiries regarding this TPZ can be directed to: \r\n311 or 311@toronto.ca   \r\nFigure 3:  Tree Protection Sign \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n9\r\nA sign that is similar to the illustration above may be required to be mounted on all sides of a tree protection barrier for trees protected by the Street Tree By-law and the Private Tree By-law. The sign should be a minimum of 40cm x 60cm and made of whit e corrugated plastic board or equivalent material. The sign may also be acquired from Urban Forestry Tree Protection and Plan Review (TPPR) district service counters. \r\n5.Tree Protection Plan\r\nAll construction related applications must include a Tree Protection Plan that shows details of tree protection, prepared in conjunction with an arborist report or in consultation with an arborist, when protected trees are in proximity to the proposed work. All Tree Protection Plans must  be legible, prepared at a usable metric scale and include the following information:  \r\n•Show all existing buildings, structures, hard surfaces and all existing trees within thearea of consideration (as defined in Section 2 of this document).  Depending on the extent of site disturbance, trees on neighbouring properties may need to be included.Note that area of disturbance must include all areas that will be disturbed by theproposed work, including the areas required for over -dig, stockpiling, construction traffic, vehicular access and construction staging•The extent of the crown (drip line) or the extent of  minimum tree protection zone TPZ (whichever is greater) of each existing tree•Proposed changes on site, including all proposed structure s, services, hard surfaces and grade changes•Indicate vehicular access and construction staging areas.  Areas proposed for temporary stockpiling of fill or excavated material shall be fenced with sediment control to preventsediment runoff•Indicate location of any excavation that requires root pruning•Indicate trees proposed to be removed and/or injured•Highlight and label tree protection barriers and the proposed tree protection zones. (SeeTable 1 to determine size of tree protection zone. Distances are to  be measured from base of tree)•The extent of proposed tree injury, where applicable.•Include a comprehensive legend\r\nSee S\r\nection 6, Tree Protection Plan Notes, and Section 7, Tree Protection Plan Details, for further information. \r\n6.Tree Protection Plan Notes\r\nThe following notes are to be included on tree protection plans submitted for construction related applications: \r\nGeneral Notes \r\n•It is the applicants’ responsibility to discuss potential impacts to trees located near orwholly on adjacent properties or on shared boundary lines with their neighbours.  Shouldsuch trees be injured to the point of instability or death the applicant may be held\r\nJuly 2016 \r\n10\r\nresponsible through civil action. The applicant would also be required to replace such trees to the satisfaction of Urban Forestry •Tree protection barriers shall be installed to standards as detailed in this document and to the satisfaction of Urban Forestry•Tree protection barriers must be installed using plywood clad hoarding (minimum 19mmor ¾\" thick) or an equivalent approved by Urban Forestry•Where required, signs as specified in Section 4, Tree Protection Signage must beattached to all sides of the barrier•Prior to the commencement of any site activity such as site alteration, demolition orconstruction, the tree protection measures specified on this plan must be installed to thesatisfaction of Urban Forestry•Once all tree/site protection measures have been installed, Urban Forestry staff must becontacted to arrange for an inspection of the site and approval of the tree/site protectionrequirements.  Photographs that clearly show the installed tree/site protection shall beprovided for Urban Forestry review•Where changes to the location of the approved TPZ or sediment control or wheretemporary access to the TPZ is proposed, Urban Forestry must be contacted to obtai n approval prior to alteration•Tree protection barriers must remain in place and in good condition during demolition, construction and/or site disturbance, including landscaping, and must not be altered,moved or removed until authorized by Urban Forestry•No construction activities including grade changes, surface treatments or excavation ofany kind are permitted within the area identified on the Tree Protection Plan or Site Planas a minimum tree protection zone (TPZ). No root cutting is permitted. No storage ofmaterials or fill is permitted within the TPZ. No movement or storage of vehicles orequipment is permitted within the TPZ. The area(s) identified as a TPZ must beprotected and remain undisturbed at all times•All additional tree protection or preservation requirements, above and beyond theinstallation of tree protection barriers, must be undertaken or implemented as detailed inthe Urban Forestry approved arborist report and/or the approved tree protection planand to the satisfaction of Urban Forestry•If the minimum tree protection zone (TPZ) must be reduced to facilitate construction access, the tree protection barriers must be maintained at a lesser distance and theexposed portion of TPZ must be protected using a horizontal root protection methodapproved by Urban Forestry•Any roots or branches indicated on this plan which require  pruning, as approved by Urban Forestry, must be pruned by an arborist. All pruning of tree roots and branchesmust be in accordance with good arboricultural practice. Roots that have receivedapproval from Urban Forestry to be pruned must first be exposed using pneumatic (air) excavation, by hand digging or by a using low pressure hydraulic (water) excavation.The water pressure for hydraulic excavation must be low enough that root bark is notdamaged or removed. This will allow a proper pruning cut and minimize tearing of the roots. The arborist retained to carry out crown or root pruning must contact UrbanForestry no less than three working days prior to conducting any specified work•The applicant/owner shall protect all by-law regulated trees in the area of considerationthat have not been approved for removal throughout development works to thesatisfaction of Urban Forestry\r\nJuly 2016 \r\n11\r\n•Convictions of offences respecting the regulations in the Street Tree By -law and Private Tree By-law are subject to fines. A person convicted of an offence under these by -laws is liable to a minimum fine of $500 and a maximum fine of $100 ,000 per tree, and /or a Special Fine of $100,000.  The landowner may be ordered by the City to stop thecontravening activity or ordered to undertake work to correct the contravention•Prior to site disturbance the owner must confirm that no migratory birds are making useof the site for nesting.  The owner must ensure that the works are in conformance withthe Migratory Bird Convention Act and that no migratory bird nests will be impacted bythe proposed work\r\nThe f\r\nollowing additional notes shall be added on plans for properties regulated by the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection Bylaw: \r\n•Ravine and N\r\natural Feature Protection By-law (RNFP) note:\r\nRavine & Natural Feature Protection By-law \r\nThe Ravine & Natural Feature Protection By-l aw, Chapter 658 of the City  of Toronto Municipal Code, \r\nregulates  t\r\nhe injury and destruction of trees, dumping of refuse and changes to grade within protected \r\nareas. \r\nUnder\r\n this by-l aw protected trees may not be removed, injured or destroyed, and protected grades may \r\nnot b\r\ne altered, without written authorisation from Urban Forestry Ravine & Natural Feature Protection, on \r\nbehalf of t\r\nhe General Manager of Parks, Forestry & Recreation. \r\nConvictions of\r\n offences respecting the regulations in the Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-l aw \r\nare subject t\r\no fines, and the landowner may be ordered by the court to restore the area to the satisfaction \r\nof the City. A person convicted of an offence under this Bylaw is liable to a minimum fine of $500 and a \r\nmaximum fine of $100,000 for each tree destroyed, a maximum fine of $100,000 for any other offence \r\ncommitted under this chapter, and /or a Special Fine of $100,000.  A person convicted of a continuing \r\noffence, including failure to comply with ravine permit conditions is liable to a maximum fine of not more \r\nthan $10,000 for each day  or a part of a day that the offence continues. \r\n•The exact location of the limit of the RNFP area must be shown on all pertinent plans\r\nincluding Tree Protection Plan.  The applicant/owner shall have this  limit marked on\r\ntheir survey\r\n or other plans drawn to a suitable scale.  This service costs $72.37 plus tax\r\nand can be requested by contacting the City of Toronto, Information and Technology,\r\nGeospatial\r\n Competency Centre, Map Service Counter at 416-392-2506 or\r\nmapsales@toronto.ca. This line may then be transferred onto other plans to be\r\nsubmitted.\r\n•Sediment control fencing shall be installed in the locations as indicated in the UrbanForestry approved sediment control plan.  The sediment control fencing must beinstalled to Ontario Provincial Standards (OPSD-219.130, see Section 7, Figure 5) andto the satisfaction of Urban Forestry. Sediment control near trees and over root zonesshall be installed as shown on Figure 6 of this document and to the satisfaction of UrbanForestry.\r\nJuly 2016 \r\n12\r\n7.

Permit application forms are available at www.toronto.ca/trees\r\n. Any requests for tree relocation \r\nwill be considered as a tree injury. \r\nIf approval is granted for removal of a City-owned tree, applicants will assume all costs involved, which include appraised tree value, removal, and tree replacement costs. If approval is granted for removal of private trees or trees in ravine and natural feature protected areas, the permit will be subject to conditions, including tree replacement. If approval is granted for injury of City - owned, private trees or trees in ravine and natural feature protected areas, the permit will be subject to conditions, including implementation of a Tree Protection Plan, as determined by Urban Forestry.  \r\nIn s\r\nome instances, where the tree is healthy and the management of the tree or forest cover has not been addressed to the satisfaction of Urban Forestry, requests received by Urban Forestry may be forwarded to a Community Council and City Council for approval.   \r\nUr\r\nban Forestry does not have the authority to issue a permit to injure or remove a heritage tree\r\n2. Such requests would be forwarded to a Community Council and/or City Council for approval. \r\nButternut (Juglans cinerea, L.) is an endangered species. Butternuts and their habitat are protected under Endangered Species Act\r\n (S.O. 2007, c.6) available on the Government of \r\nOntario website at http://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/07e06/v1 .

Tree Guarantee Deposits\r\nTree Protection Guarantee \r\nUrban Forestry may request a tree protection guarantee to secure the protection of trees that may be impacted by work on city streets, or to secure the satisfaction of all conditions of permit issuance. Tree protection guarantees held by the City shall only be released by the City provided that all construction activities are complete, compliance with all permit terms and conditions has been verified, there has been no encroachment into the minimum tree protection zone (TPZ) and the trees are healthy and in a state of vigorous growth.  \r\nWhere Urban Forestry has confirmed an unauthorized encroachment into the TPZ or the terms and conditions of a permit have not been complied with, Urban Forestry  will retain the guarantee until satisfactory compliance.  \r\nIt\r\n is the applicant’s responsibility to submit a written request to Urban Forestry for the refund of the tree protection guarantee deposit as soon as construction and landscaping is completed.  \r\nTree Planting Security \r\nUrban Forestry may request a tree planting security deposit  in an amount equal to the cost of planting and maintenance for two (2) years in order to ensure compliance with approved landscape or replanting plans.  The security deposit may be held by the City after the planting of the trees for a period of two (2) years and shall be released by the City provided that the trees  have been maintained, are healthy and in a state of vigorous growth upon inspection, two (2) years after planting. It is the applicant’s responsibility to advise Urban Forestry  that trees have been planted in accordance with approved plans, in order that the two (2) year maintenance period begin. \r\nPr\r\nior to release by the City, any dead/dying trees must be replaced, deadwood and sucker growth should be pruned, and mulch should be topped up where necessary. If stakes and ties were used, they must be removed within one (1) year. Any encroachments are to be removed prior to assumption, including walkways, timbers or bricks that result in increased height of soil or mulch around the trees, and lights in trees.  \r\nIt\r\n is the applicant’s responsibility to submit a written request to Urban Forestry  for the refund of a Tree Guarantee Deposit, two (2) years after the completion of all construction activity and/or two (2) years after tree planting. This request should be made during the growing season, not while \r\nJuly 2016 \r\n16\r\nthe trees are dormant, so that a site inspection can be arranged to confirm the trees are acceptable. The City will not release security deposits where trees are not in good condition, or if there are encroachments.  \r\nFinancial securities must be in the form of a certified cheque, letter of credit or an alternative acceptable to Urban Forestry, with amounts payable to the Treasurer, City of Toronto. \r\n10.Emergency Repairs to Utilities\r\nThe utility company is responsible for notifying Urban Forestry by calling 311 as soon as possible when by-law regulated trees are involved, so that an inspector can be dispatched. Urban Forestry staff may be contacted after hours by calling  311, and requesting the assistance of an on-call Urban Forestry inspector. \r\n11.Tree Species that are Intolerant of ConstructionDisturbance \r\nThe following tree species are intolerant of construction disturbance, and tree protection plans must take this into account.

Bids that that are substantially \r\nincomplete or do not substantially comply with t he requirements of this RFQ \r\nwill be excluded from consideration in Stage 2.  \r\n Stage 2:  The compliant Bids will be ranked on the basis of the lowest \r\nsubmitted pricing of each Bid in accordance with the Pricing Form.  \r\n.2 Subject to its reserved rights set out in this Part, the City may at any time and from \r\ntime to time, in its sole and absolute discretion, revisit, revise, confirm or adjust the \r\nevaluations of a Bid at any time during the RFQ process.  \r\n.2 Tied Bids  \r\nIn the event that the City receives two (2) or more  Bids identical in price, the City reserves \r\nthe right to select one of such Bids as set out in the Tied Bid procedure under the Purchasing \r\nProcurement Processes Policy of the City’s Policies and Legislation. The Tied Bid \r\nprocedure allows for the City to fi rst consider whether any of the relevant Suppliers are a \r\nDiverse Supplier as defined in the Social Procurement Policy to break the tie. If no such \r\nSupplier is a Diverse Supplier, then the tie will be broken by way of coin toss or lottery.  \r\n.3 Materially Unbala nced or Abnormally Low Bids  \r\n.1 A Bid is materially unbalanced if:  \r\n• it is based on prices which are significantly less than cost for some items \r\nand prices which are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other \r\nitems; and  \r\n \r\n• the City has determined t hat the Bid may not result in the lowest overall cost \r\nto the City even though it may be the lowest submitted Bid; or  \r\n \r\n• it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.  \r\n.2 A Bid is abnormally low if the pricing, in combination with other constituent elements \r\nof the Bid, appears unreasonably low to the extent that the pricing  raises material \r\nconcerns with the City as to the capability of the Supplier to perform the Contract on \r\nthe basis of the offered pricing.  \r\n.3 If a materially unbalanced Bid or an abnormally low Bid is identified, the City may \r\nseek clarification from the Supplier, including a detailed price analysis of its pricing \r\nin relation to the subject matter of the Contract, the scope, the estimated quantities,  \r\nRequest for Quotations  Doc3742825440   \r\nPart 1 – RFQ Process – Section 2  \r\n \r\nPage 15 \r\n the schedule for Contract performance, the allocation of risks and responsibilities \r\nand any other requirements of RFQ.  \r\n.4 If after evaluation of the price analysis, the City determines that the Supplier has \r\nfailed to demonstrate its capability to perform the Contract on the basis of the offered \r\npricing, or that the offered pricing in constitutes a material risk to the City, the City \r\nmay reject the Bid.  \r\n2.2 Rights of the City  \r\nIn addition to, but without limiting any other rights or options of the City under thi s RFQ, the City may, \r\nin its sole and absolute discretion carry out the RFQ process as it determines to be in the best \r\ninterests of the City and to be the most beneficial to City.

It shall also \r\nconstitute sufficient grounds to suspend the supplier from further bidding for such \r\nperiod of time as may be determined under the City\'s Supplier Code of Conduct. \r\nThe City may then award the contract to the supplier offering the next lowe st bid \r\nprice.  \r\n \r\n2.4 Notification to Other Suppliers  \r\nOnce the Successful Supplier is notified that the City has awarded the Contract, the other Suppliers \r\nwill be notified by the City in writing through the internal messaging function of the City Online \r\nProcureme nt System of the outcome of the RFQ process.  \r\n2.5 Offers to Agencies and Corporations  \r\nAfter acceptance of a Bid, the Successful Supplier acknowledges and agrees that the City may \r\ninform its agencies and corporations of the Successful Supplier’s Contract with t he City.

It is essential for the team to have the ability to think strategically, and possess highly refined technical skills in order to successfully deliver the scope of work  1.2 VISION \r\n.1 Toronto\'s public spaces – its streets, paths, parks, squares, ravines, waterfront promenades, schoolyards and other open spaces – is where civic life happens. These public spaces set the stage for daily social interaction in the city as people travel to work or school, move around to shop or find something to eat, take in a festival or cultural event, get active in a park or playground, or just sit back and enjoy public life. Green infrastructure and the urban tree canopy play a vital role in creating these high-quality public spaces that we enjoy, and provide a critical role in making these spaces comfortable. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events, resulting from a changing climate, increases the need for public space to be designed for heat relief and weather resiliency. Expanding the urban forest and accelerating the implementation of GI through Green Streets have long been acknowledged as some of the City\'s key tools to address current and future impacts of climate change.    .2 Toronto\'s urban forest covers 28.4%-31% of the City\'s land area and is estimated to sequester about 35,165 gross tonnes of carbon annually. Working towards Toronto\'s tree canopy target of 40% by 2050 requires maximizing opportunities to plant trees within City-owned road allowances. Providing optimal growing conditions that support the maturation of trees is critical to the success of combating climate change and increasing resiliency.  Once mature, trees provide their maximum potential benefits to the ecosystem by increasing carbon sequestration, providing heat relief, and supporting biodiversity by providing wildlife and insect habitat.  \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 2   .3 To help achieve the City’s goals for the urban forest, the City\'s Official Plan includes policies to support the health and growth of the urban forest, biodiversity and the design and implementation of complete streets and GI. These policies are designed to support the expansion of the carbon sequestration capacity of street trees while serving a critical role in enhancing the City\'s resilience to extreme heat and weather events.  .4 To increase the amount and scale of greening through GI, the City\'s long term intention is to shift the current approach to GI implementation from opportunistic to proactive and strategic, where GI influences and leads decisions through the capital program planning and implementation stages. It is envisioned that this proactive approach could form a catalyst for other reactive programs (i.e. cycling, vision zero) to lead capital planning and programming.   1.3 PROJECT TOPICS .1 Green Infrastructure   The Supplier shall note that where \'Green Infrastructure\' (\'GI\') is referenced, it refers to both or either of the following:  ● GI facilities, in accordance with the City\'s Green Infrastructure Standards ● Tree planting in accordance with the City’s Design Options for Tree Planting in Hard Surfaces (https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/building-\r\nconstruction/infrastructure-city-construction/construction-standards-\r\npermits/standards-for-designing-and-constructing-city-\r\ninfrastructure/?accordion=green-infrastructure-standards ).  \r\n .2 Capital Program  The Supplier shall note that references to the \'Capital Program\' refer to the City\'s 5-year projected capital program and includes the below listed programs. The City will provide the Supplier with the 5-year (2022-2027) Capital Program in GIS database format. Note that the City’s 5-year capital plans are subject to change for a variety of reasons.   The Supplier shall note that the program information will be similar to that provided on the City\'s externally available TOInview (https://map.toronto.ca/toinview/), \r\nhowever, the externally available format only represents a 3 year (2021-2024) Capital Program.    \r\nThe Infrastructure Coordination Unit (ICU) at the City of Toronto is committed to \r\nworking with partners to deliver a fully coordinated construction program in the City \r\nof Toronto. The ICU guides the multi-year coordination process for planned \r\nconstruction projects to be completed by City Divisions, utilities and third party \r\ngroups. The ICU mandate is to reduce the impact and disruption from construction \r\nactivities within the city may have on the public.   \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 3   Data for the following capital programs will be provided to the Supplier for use in this project:  - Transportation Services  o Road Resurfacing o Road Reconstruction o Sidewalk Construction o Bridge Rehabilitation o Transportation Safety and Local Improvement o Infrastructure Enhancement o Green Streets o Neighbourhood Improvement o Local Geometric Safety Improvements  o Cycling Infrastructure & Programs o Vision Zero - Toronto Water o Watermain Replacement o Sewer Replacement o Stormwater Management o Basement Flooding Protection Program - City Planning o Civic Improvements - Economic Development and Culture o Business Improvement Area Project - Parks, Forestry & Recreation o Construction - Other programs o Metrolinx Projects  o TTC Projects o Engineering & Construction Services  .3 Development Applications   The Supplier shall note that references to \'Development Applications\' refers to development applications that appear on the City\'s Application Information Centre (https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/application-information-centre/).  \r\n Development Applications are referenced throughout the RFP for the purposes of potential integration of GI in the ROW with development related work. As such, the City envisions that the Supplier shall focus on those applications that under the \'Timeline\' details are noted as \'Application Received\' or \'Application Circulated to City Divisions for Feedback\'. Applications that are beyond this stage such as those at the \'First Stage of Approval\' or beyond, need not be considered. Additionally, the City envisions that the Supplier will narrow the focus of Development Applications to those that are of a larger scale (e.g. project in scale such as the Well at Wellington and Front Street) and, as a result, have an increased opportunity for GI implementation. Applications for developments with a single frontage facing the ROW need not be considered, unless multiple applications are in close proximity (on the same street) and have a significant cumulative impact to GI implementation. \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 4   .4 Development Infrastructure Policy and Standards  The Development Infrastructure Policy and Standards (\'DIPS\') consists of a range of standardized cross-sectional designs for new streets. The Supplier shall note that the City is currently advancing with updates to the DIPS; the updates will account for the inclusion of GI and cycling infrastructure which were not previously incorporated. Furthermore, space for facilities (i.e. minimum sidewalk widths, pavement widths) will also be updated. This work is scheduled for completion by Q1 of 2023 and any available updates during the stage of this work will be provided to the Supplier.   .5 Municipal Consent Requirements  The Municipal Consent Requirements (\'MCR\') outlines requirements for proposed installations within the City ROW, for utility companies, commissions, agencies, boards, municipal departments and private stakeholders.  The Supplier shall note that the City is currently reviewing proposed changes to the MCR that include the following:   ● Provision of updated specifications as they relate to utility cut restorations and tree protection in paved boulevards during construction  ● Reassessment of utility clearances through consultation with internal and external stakeholders ● Outlining timing, procedures, roles and responsibilities related to engaging third party utilities early into the development review and capital process   The updates to the MCR are currently ongoing; any available updates during this scope of work will be provided to the Supplier.  .6 Green Streets Project Selection Process   The City currently utilizes the Green Streets Project Selection Process to implement GI using an opportunistic approach based on the City\'s Capital Program, specifically the Transportation Services State of Good Repair Program. The process uses co-benefits of GI as the primary driver to determine candidate GI projects that will eventually form the Green Streets Capital Works Program. The process includes three major components: GIS Analysis, Desktop Analysis and Stakeholder Consultation. The GIS Analysis component utilizes existing GIS data on the following co-benefit parameters:  ● Stormwater Management ● Air Quality ● Tree Canopy Distribution ● Social Equity  ● Climate Resilience   The Supplier will be provided with the GIS data pertaining to the above noted co-benefit parameters.   \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 5   Additional details on the Green Streets Selection process can be found here: https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9680-ecs-specs-gi-appendix-a-green-streets-selection-process-Sep2021.p \r\n 1.4 SCOPE OF WORK – STAGE 1 \r\n.1 General Overview \r\n Stage 1 consists of two major components: establishing the study design and objectives; and completing a background review and additional stakeholder consultation. The City envisions that the deliverables from this stage will form a foundation that will enable successful delivery of the remaining Stages.   A. The City will require that the Supplier review the deliverables identified under each Stage, as outlined in the RFP, and develop a work plan based on the objectives identified within each Stage.  B. In 2021, the City engaged an external consultant to complete a study which resulted in a report called Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory. The study was completed in 2022. The purpose of this study was to highlight conflicting policies, guidelines, standards and other documents which ultimately create barriers to effective implementation and application of the City’s objectives in the right-of-way. This study was accomplished through an inventory and review of City documents as well as through internal stakeholder consultation. Under this Stage, the City will require that the Supplier utilize the findings of Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory to identify existing barriers, gaps and limitations specific to GI implementation. The Supplier would also be required to complete any additional stakeholder consultation required to identify barriers, gaps and limitations that are not already identified. This work will form a baseline for the work in Stage 4 which includes the provision of recommended mechanisms, not already identified in the Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory, in the form of new or updated policies, standards or guidelines. The goal of this is to enable the City to mitigate the barriers that currently exist with respect to effective implementation of GI.    .2 Scope and Deliverables \r\n A. Study Design and Objectives  i. The Supplier shall confirm the actions required to achieve the objectives identified within each Stage of the RFP.   ii. The Supplier shall provide a project Work Plan with refinements which include all actions required to support the submission of all deliverables identified in each Stage.   B. Background Review and Stakeholder Consultation \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 6    i. The Supplier shall review Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory, included in Appendix A.   ii. The Supplier shall identify and provide a summary of existing gaps, barriers or limitations with respect to the implementation of GI as it pertains to planning, approvals, and permitting that are identified in Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory.   iii. The Supplier shall review the documents that were included in the Right-of-Way Development Policy Inventory (Appendix A) and identify and conduct any additional stakeholder consultation required to identify remaining gaps, barriers or limitations with respect to the implementation of GI as it pertains to planning, approvals, and permitting. The Supplier shall provide a summary of the additional stakeholder consultation required, and a summary of the existing planning gaps and limitations identified through the additional consultations.    .3 Summary of Deliverables   Section No. Deliverable Format \r\n1.4.2A.ii Refined Work Plan  Report \r\n1.4.2B.ii Background Review – Summary of Gaps Report \r\n1.4.2B.iii Summary and Findings from additional Stakeholder Consultation  Report \r\n   1.5 SCOPE OF WORK – STAGE 2 \r\n.1 General Overview  \r\n Stage 2 consists of several major components:  development of a decision making framework; creation of a Green Streets Master Plan; identification of utility conflicts; and preparation of Streetscape Plans. The goal of this is to enable the City to mitigate the barriers that currently exist with respect to effective implementation of GI.   A. Decision Making Framework   The Decision Making Framework (DMF) is a tool that will be used both within the scope of this Study and following the completion of this Study. The purpose of the DMF is to help determine where GI should be implemented city-wide by identifying Priority Neighbourhoods that are experiencing vulnerability due to the impact of climate change and equity, while also balancing the feasibility of GI construction.  \r\n \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 7   Within the scope of this Study, the DMF will be used to identify the Priority Neighbourhoods and Focus Areas in the City’s ROW that will form the Green Streets Master Plan. With respect to implementation, the DMF will also be used to determine which Priority Neighbourhoods can be coordinated with the 5-year Capital Plan and active Development Applications for potential integration of works to maximize the overall implementation of GI city-wide, with an equitable lens. The DMF will consider items outlined in Section 1.5.2.A   Following the completion of this study, the DMF will continue to be used by the City to determine future Priority Neighbourhoods and/or future Focus Areas, as well as to identify opportunities for future coordination of Priority Neighbourhoods within the Capital Program and major Development Applications.   All development applications will continue to be required to meet all policies, guidelines and standards including Toronto Green Standard. The DMF will be used to support the implementation of GI in the ROW on development sites and capital projects.   B. Green Streets Master Plan   The Supplier shall prepare a Green Streets Master Plan. The Green Streets Master Plan will contain a number of components: Priority Neighbourhoods; Focus Areas; Capital Program; and active Development Applications. The purpose of the Master Plan is to provide a map that outlines where the overall focus of GI should be within the city while also identifying geographic areas where there is an overlap between Priority Neighbourhoods and works that are proposed under the Capital Plan and Development Applications. This would ultimately be used to identify alignments between the Priority Neighbourhoods, Capital Plan and Development activity.   i. The Supplier will identify geographic areas that are deemed a priority (the \'Priority Neighbourhoods\'), for GI implementation. The Priority Neighbourhoods will be determined through application of the DMF. The Supplier will also be required to identify any geographic areas where there are data gaps (i.e. no existing studies, no GIS data through the Green Streets Project Selection Process, etc.), where the need for GI implementation may be overlooked as a result. The identification of Priority Neighbourhoods will form a basis of the Green Streets Master Plan, which is further outlined under Stage 2. Furthermore, the identification of geographic \'gaps\' will provide the City with an outline of areas requiring additional study and/or assessment. Priority Neighbourhoods are further described in Section 1.5.2.B.   ii. The Supplier will identify Focus Areas within the Priority Neighbourhoods. There will be a maximum of five (5) Focus Areas across the city. The DMF will be used to identify the Focus Areas, which will provide a baseline for the deliverables outlined under Section \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 8   1.1.1.2F (Streetscape Plans) and 1.1.1.2A (Design Solutions Tool Kit). Focus Areas are further described in Section 1.5.2.C.   The Master Plan will overlay the City\'s Capital Plan and Development Applications. This will provide the City with an indication of where opportunities exist to potentially coordinate GI scope with Capital and Development projects within the Priority Neighbourhoods.   C. Utility Conflicts   The Supplier shall identify conflicts and/or constraints within the Focus Areas between potential GI and existing utilities. This work will form a baseline for the development of the Green Streets Design Solutions Tool Kit further outlined in Stage 3. The utility conflicts that are identified will also impact the proposed options for Streetscape Plans as outlined below.    D. Streetscape Plans   The Supplier shall prepare a set of Streetscape Plans. The Streetscape Plans will be applicable to the streets identified in the Focus Areas and be informed by a spatial assessment of the ROW above and below grade including utilities, as well as the street typology as defined in the Complete Streets Guidelines and relevant City standards identified in Appendix B.  While the Streetscape Plans will be developed for the streets within the Focus Areas, the City will ultimately use these as representative plans, to be applied to other streets with similar typologies outside of the Focus Areas.   .2 Scope & Deliverables   A. Decision-Making Framework   The Supplier shall develop a Decision-Making Framework (DMF) that will be used to determine ‘Priority Neighbourhoods’ and the further refined ‘Focus Areas’ and integrate the Design Solution Tool Kit see Section 1.6.2.v.  The DMF shall take into account, at a minimum, the following:  i. The objectives identified within each Stage of the RFP   ii. The DMF should enable the City to mitigate the long-term and short-term barriers that currently exist with respect to predictable implementation of GI and utility conflicts as described in Section 1.5.2.E   iii. Considerations, objectives or priorities identified in the City-wide plans, studies and applications. The Supplier shall review the following plans and studies at a minimum:  ● Secondary Plans (https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-\r\ndevelopment/official-plan-guidelines/official-plan/chapter-6-\r\nsecondary-plans/) \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 9   ● Parks and Public Realm Plans ● 2018 Tree Canopy Study land cover classification and tree equity analysis ● Development application pipeline data, to be provided by City Planning.    iv.

Feasibility of integration and bundling of work proposed in the Priority Neighbourhoods with: ● Capital Program  ● Development Applications   vii. Opportunities for utilities to be moved, upgraded or replaced to make space for GI based on factors such as age or material of infrastructure.   B. Priority Neighbourhoods   i. The Supplier shall use the City’s New Social Planning Neighbourhoods (see Appendix G) https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/964e-New-158-Neighbourhoods-with-Streets-\r\nand-List-Table.pdf. ) as a basis to identify approximately for GI \r\nimplementation based on the application of the DMF. It should be noted that Priority Neighbourhoods may range in scale. The focus shall be on the area within the City ROW only and should not include private property or City parks. Identification of the Priority Neighbourhoods will form the basis of the Green Streets Master Plan as further defined in Section 1.1.5.1B  ii. The Priority Neighbourhoods shall be outlined in tabular format within the submitted report in the following format, broken down by street:   Priority Neighbourhood Area 1: Street From To \r\nStreet A Street B Street C \r\nStreet X Street Y Street Z \r\n Priority Neighbourhood Area 2: Street From To \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 10   Street D Street E Street F Street U Street V Street W \r\n iii. The Priority Neighbourhoods must be identified and summarized in the Green Streets Master Plan reporting (including tables, figures, etc.) and must also be provided to the City in GIS format. See Appendix E for details of requirements.   iv. The Supplier shall identify any geographic gaps; this would include any geographic areas that are not already assessed within an existing City-wide plan or study or for which there is no GIS Data available through the Green Streets Project Selection Process. The geographic gaps are areas where additional studies or data would be required in order to identify specific needs relating to GI implementation. See Appendix E for details of GIS submittal requirements, including mapping and excel tables.  C. Focus Areas  i. The Supplier shall further refine the Priority Neighbourhoods into Focus Areas utilizing the DMF. The intent is for the Supplier to develop a more detailed approach to GI implementation in these Focus Areas, including cross-sections and plans to be carried to design phases. The Focus Areas shall be within five (5) separate Priority Neighbourhoods. A typical Focus Area will comprise one city neighbourhood with a minimum of 4-5 plans and sections as per Streetscape Plans (1.5.2.F) for each typology identified within the Focus Area. Identification of the Focus Areas will be incorporated into the Green Streets Master Plan as further defined in Section 1.5.2D.  ii. The Focus Areas shall be identified in the same Tabular format as the Priority Neighbourhoods.  iii. The Focus Areas shall be outlined in GIS format. See Appendix E for details of requirements.  D. Green Streets Master Plan  i. The Supplier shall prepare a Green Streets Master Plan in GIS format (see Appendix E for requirements) which includes the following:  ● Priority Neighbourhoods  ● Focus Areas ● Capital Program  ● Development Applications   E. Utility Conflicts   i. The Supplier shall identify conflicts and/or constraints within the Focus Areas between potential GI and existing utilities.   \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 11   ii. The Supplier shall familiarize themselves with the contents in the MCR regarding requirements of the utility offsets.   iii. The Supplier will be provided with access to the Toronto Water Asset Geodatabase (TWAG) and Digital Map Owners Group (DMOG) which contains existing utility information. It should be noted that data gaps may exist within either the TWAG or DMOG system and, as such, the Supplier shall supplement the utility information in TWAG and DMOG with record/as-built drawings. This can be requested via EngDrawings@toronto.ca (additional details found at https://www.toronto.ca/citygovernment/data-research-maps/utility-maps-engineering-drawings/). All utilities need to be identified, both City and \r\nthird party utilities.    iv. The Supplier shall note that the location of proposed GI facilities will vary within the ROW and may be placed within the boulevard, roadway or centre median depending on the facility selected. Worker safety shall be accounted for when looking at relocation of utilities, to ensure planned relocation, spacing, and other factors facilitate safe maintenance, operation, and repair, as aligned with all applicable regulations and best practices.   v. Conflicts and constraints (e.g. offsets and clearances) between proposed GI and existing utility locations shall be identified in a GIS database, and represented within tables and figures in the report. The DMF will inform this work.  The following should be identified, at a minimum: ● Focus Area and street where conflict and/or constraint exists  ● Utilities/facilities causing the conflict and/or constraint  ● Offset to the conflicting utilities/facilities   F. Streetscape Plans  i. The Supplier shall review all of the streets within the Focus Areas and prepare an inventory of ROW widths and Street Typologies as defined in the City’s Complete Streets Guideline.  ii. The Supplier shall prepare Streetscape Plans for each existing corresponding ROW width and Street Typology.

The Streetscape Plans shall include space accommodations for GI; a separate plan shall be prepared for each GI facility depending on available spacing including estimated soil volume.  \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 12    iv. The proposed Streetscape Plans should take into account any available and relevant updates to DIPS and MCR.   .3 Summary of Deliverables  Section No. Deliverable Format \r\n1.5.2 A Decision Making Framework Report  \r\n1.5.2D.i Green Streets Master Plan, including: Report/ GIS  \r\n1.5.2B.i Priority Neighbourhoods – Identify Areas  \r\n1.5.2B.iv Priority Neighbourhoods – Identify geographic gaps \r\n1.5.2C.i Focus Areas – Identify Areas \r\n1.5.2E Identify utility conflicts within Focus Areas \r\n1.5.2F Streetscape Plans PDF/Micro station / \r\nAutoCAD \r\n  1.6 SCOPE OF WORK – STAGE 3 \r\n.1 General Overview  \r\n A. Stage 3 consists of two major components; the creation of cross sections for GI in the Focus Areas, as part of a Green Streets Design Solutions Tool Kit, and the preparation of cost estimates.   B. The purpose of the Design Solutions Tool Kit is to develop cross-sections for GI within individual Focus Areas, and integrate them with Streetscape Plans (developed in Stage 2), ROW Street typologies, and the location of utilities. The Design Solutions Tool Kit should incorporate solutions to avoid or mitigate conflicts with trees and GI (e.g. utility relocation). The City currently has DIPS cross-sections for local streets, the GI Standards and Specifications, and utility offset requirements as outlined in the MCR. Additionally, the work completed under Stage 1, which includes the identification of gaps and limitations to GI implementation, shall be accounted for in the preparation of the cross-sections.   C. The Supplier to provide GI alternatives for each Focus Area along with their analysis of associated benefits. City staff will review and select the preferred option.  D. The Supplier will be required to prepare cost estimates for GI associated with each street typology. The cost estimates will serve as an indication as to the overall life cycle cost of the GI, should it be decided to be constructed.  E. The Supplier will be required to develop an interdivisional cost sharing model for the lifecycle of the GI; impacted divisions include Toronto Water, Transportation Services and Parks, Forestry & Recreation (Urban Forestry).  \r\nRequest for Proposals – Doc3670282580  Part 3 – Requirements for Deliverables – Section 1 \r\n \r\nPage 13   .2 Scope & Deliverables  A.

There are multiple stakeholders with interest in the public boulevard. Due to finite space and increasing user pressures, the City needs to establish a balance between enhancing the pedestrian clearway, providing sufficient growing space for shade trees and GI, and protecting/ maintaining existing infrastructure. The Growing Green Streets Implementation Strategy must recommend strategies to resolve conflicts between existing infrastructure, trees and GI. Delivering Green Streets that include large-growing native trees and GI are the key drivers behind this work.    Initiative: The City has identified the need to develop a decision-making framework for prioritizing trees and GI and the need to develop an implementation strategy that guides strategic investment of trees and GI in the City’s road allowances. The Growing Green Streets initiative will support the expansion of Toronto\'s tree canopy and Green Streets.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  \r\n \r\nQ1.   Can the City please clarify the scope of data collection required for this project? It would \r\nbe helpful to get a sense of the expectations of site visits/counts to best estimate budget \r\nrequirements. Does this include private parking operators, for example? \r\n \r\nA1.  There is no anticipated primary data collection for this assignment. We expect the \r\nsuccessful proponent to draw from existing and available data sources to complete the \"Existing \r\nParking Inventory in Toronto\" interim report—some of the data which the City will provide (e.g. \r\nresidential permit parking and Green P lots). As it relates to Section 1.2.4 in the RFP, we expect \r\nthe successful proponent to design a data collection program that meets the Strategy\'s \r\nemerging objectives. References in this section that discuss primary data collection refers to \r\ndeveloping a proven valid and cost-effective way to procure/collect the data necessary to satisfy \r\nthose Strategy objectives. \r\n \r\n  \r\nQ2.   Can the City please clarify how it sees the interim reports fitting into the 10-phase structure \r\nand schedule of the Strategy Development outlined in 1.2.5? \r\n \r\nA2.  As noted in Section 1.2.5, the Supplier will create an Interim Report reporting schedule in \r\nPhase 1: Project Planning , which will be presented to the Steering Committee for approval. The \r\ndevelopment and presentation of the Interim Reports to the Steering Committee will be ongoing \r\nthroughout appropriate project phases as per the approved reporting schedule. Expectations \r\npertaining to the presentation of Interim Reports to the Steering Committee are outlined in \r\nSection 1.2.1 Primary Deliverable Overview and Interim Reports . \r\n \r\n \r\nQ3.   Does the City of Toronto have an existing public engagement platform that can be \r\nused/leveraged? What engagement platforms does the City offer in relation to interactive \r\ncontent?   \r\n \r\n2 A3.  The Supplier must provide all elements relating to the proposed public consultation and \r\nstakeholder engagement plans. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ4.   Is it required that the Supplier’s team be comprised of all the positions named on the \r\npricing evaluation sheet? \r\n \r\nA4.  No. If the Supplier does not intend on using all staff position role titles as noted in the \r\nPricing Evaluation Sheet, the Supplier may leave those fields blank. The Supplier may identify \r\nother relevant staff positions it feels would be beneficial to their Project Team. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ5   Are there any specific requirements/qualifications for these positions? \r\n \r\nA5.  As per Subsection 4 in Form B Technical  Proposal and Qualifications Proposed Staff \r\nTeam and Resources , the Supplier must identify \"a comprehensive list of key staff that the \r\nSupplier would propose to use for this work together with their professional qualifications, \r\nrelated project experience and an indication of their duties and responsibilities on this particular \r\nproject.\" \r\n \r\n \r\nQ6.   Can we propose more than one individual for each position? \r\n \r\nA6.  Yes. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ7.   Can a member of the team be proposed for more than one position? \r\n             \r\nA7.  Yes. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ8.   Can the City please clarify the use of the word “classification” on Part 4 Form B page 6 of \r\n9: “Proposed project staffing over the assignment period should include numbers by \r\n“classification”  for key staff as well as all other staff.”  \r\n \r\nA8.  In this case, \"classification\" refers to the position title (e.g. Project Manager, Analyst). \r\n \r\n \r\nQ9.   The RFP mentions that the Parking Pricing Strategies Interim Report should address fee \r\nstructure and penalty amounts. Could the City provide greater details on the expected level of \r\ndetail and the format of these (e.g., principle level vs approaches vs specific rates etc.)? \r\n             \r\nA9.  The Parking Pricing Strategies Interim Report must provide rate setting principles, \r\nguidelines and considerations for establishing and reviewing parking rates structures for on and \r\noff-street parking in various settings across the city. The report must also provide a discussion \r\non the relationship between on and off-street rate setting, as well as include principles, \r\nguidelines and considerations for structuring penalty amounts for parking violations. The interim \r\nreport is not intended to provide specific rates however rate structures and high-level peer \r\nbenchmarking are necessary to support consultant recommendations. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ10.   For the ROW Mobility Interim Report, can the City please clarify what is meant by \r\n“specific review of various pricing fees and pricing models”? is this referring to fees and pricing \r\n3 models used in other jurisdictions? Or development and review of proposed new models for \r\nToronto? We are trying to understand the level of detail required. \r\n             \r\nA10.  For the Interim Report, it is recommended that the Supplier review contemporary parking \r\npricing fees and models which may have been or are applied in other jurisdictions. It is expected \r\nthat the Supplier will use the information gained through the Interim Report in the development \r\nof the Parking Strategy document. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ11.   For the ROW Mobility Interim Report, can the City please clarify what is meant by “full \r\nreview of all residential, front-yard and boulevard permit parking programs”? We are trying to \r\nunderstand the level of detail required. Will the City provide the Supplier with existing data on \r\npermitted parking across the city?             \r\n \r\nA11.  The City will provide the Supplier with all available information, data and inventories for all \r\nresidential, front-yard and boulevard permit parking programs. A full review of these existing \r\nprograms will benefit the Supplier when considering the implementable actions required during \r\nthe development of the Parking Strategy. \r\n \r\n \r\nQ12.   How does the City expect parking for goods movement to be addressed in the parking \r\nstrategy?             \r\n \r\nA12.  The City expects the Supplier to familiarize themselves with the Council-approved Freight \r\nand Goods Management Strategy as provided in Section 2.1 Background.  \r\n \r\n \r\nQ13.   Can the City please provide more clarity on the level of detail required for addressing \r\nparking enforcement in the Parking Pricing Strategies Interim Report? Would the proposal for \r\n“the most appropriate pricing strategy” that includes Violation Notice amounts be better placed \r\nin the full Strategy development instead of the Interim Report?   \r\n \r\nA13.  The Parking Pricing Strategies Interim Report must provide an examination and review of \r\nParking Violation Notice penalty amounts for both on and off-street settings and may also be \r\nincluded in the full Parking Strategy report.  \r\n \r\nQ14.   The RFP mentions that the Parking Pricing Strategies Interim Report should address fee \r\nstructure and penalty amounts. Could the City provide greater details on the expected level of \r\ndetail and the format of these (e.g., principle level vs approaches vs specific rates etc.)? \r\n             \r\nA14.  See A9.  \r\n \r\n \r\nQ15.   What is expected in terms of the examination of “car share program operations” in the \r\nExisting Parking Inventory? Would this be a count of A-to-A car share parking spots across the \r\nCity, or a policy/permitting reviews related to A-to-B car share operations? Or both? Or other? \r\n \r\nA15.  The examination of car share program operations is intended to report on the size and \r\nscale of the program across on-street, TPA off-street, and private off-street parking inventories \r\nin order to provide a holistic view and identify areas of the City that are under-served. An \r\nunderstanding of both A-to-A and A-to-B models would be helpful to quantify and spatially \r\ndisplay on a map. A discussion on car share program fee structures and policy frameworks are \r\nalso required in report. \r\n \r\n4 Q16.   Would the City be amenable to proponents proposing an alternative set of Interim \r\nReports that cover `all required areas? (i.e., shifting topics to different groupings). \r\n \r\nA16.  The Supplier will present an Interim Reporting Schedule to the Steering Committee during \r\nPhase 1: Project Planning, as described in Section 1.2.5 Strategy Development Methodology \r\nand Process. If the successful proponent wishes to suggest adjustments or alternatives to the \r\nInterim Report design, it would occur at that time. \r\n \r\nQ17.   What is the expectation for the City\'s Public Consultation Unit to be involved in the public \r\nengagement required for this RFP? \r\n \r\n \r\nA17.  At this time there is no expectation for the City\'s Public Consultation unit to be involved in \r\nthe public engagement required for this RFP. \r\n \r\n \r\nSuppliers must acknowledge receipt of all addenda on the space provided on the submission \r\nform (Part 4-Form A) as per Part 1-Request for Proposal Process under Section 1-RFP \r\nProcess, item 1.7 (Addenda), of the call document.

Background  \r\nThe successful bidder of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) will undertake four (4)  Net \r\nZero Emission Feasibility Studies  and  Climate Change Resilience Assessment s at 73, \r\n111, 113, and 136 Spadina Road.  \r\n \r\n2.1.1.  Zero Emission Study  \r\nToronto City Council has adopted the TransformTO  strategy on December 15, 2021 to \r\nreduce community -wide greenho use gas (GHG) emissions in Toronto to net zero by \r\n2040. Council wants the City Corporation to lead the community by example, and \r\n2021.IE26.16 clause 1(f)  instructed that \"as of 2023, any new equipment being installed \r\nin a City facility must contribute to net zero and all new buildings be designed and built \r\nto net zero.\" These actions build on the Climate Emergency  (2019.MM10.3) declared by \r\nCouncil on October 2, 2019.  \r\nIn support of these initiatives, Corporate Real Estate Management presented a Net Zero \r\nCarbon Plan  (2021.IE23.2 ) which was accepted by council for information on July 24, \r\n2021. This plan describes how City buildings will achieve net zero emissions status \r\nincrementally , synchronous ly with the application of a climate lens and Financial \r\nPlanning\'s asset management strategy. F uel switching and efficiency retrofits are the \r\nprimary method for emissions reductions.  \r\nIn order to integrate retrofits into the Capital Planning Process, the Ci ty needs to \r\ndevelop budget and timeline estimates for each individual building to achieve zero \r\nemissions. The net zero studies described by this scope will inform these estimates and \r\nsupport decisions for strategic divestment and renewal.  \r\n \r\n2.1.2.  Climate Change R esilience Assessment  \r\nToronto’s Resilience Strategy  sets out a vision, goals, and actions to help Toronto \r\nsurvive, adapt and thrive in the face of any challen ge, particularly climate change and \r\ngrowing inequities. Both ch ronic stresses and acute shocks are considered.  \r\nRecoveryTO  provides a snapshot of the City’s recovery and rebuild decisions, reports, \r\ndata, dashboards, and media announcement s. As a city we are experiencing one of the \r\nmost challenging periods in our recent history with significant  economic, social and \r\nhealth implications and disproportionate impacts to Toronto’s Black, Indigenous and \r\nequity -deserving communities. While the City continues to respond to the immediate \r\nneeds of our residents, communities and business, we are also layin g the foundation \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n2 \r\n \r\n \r\nand taking action for the social and economic recovery of our City. Climate Action & \r\nResilience  is one of RecoveryTO\'s six themes.  \r\nCorporate Real Estate Management helps support urban resilience goals by offering the \r\nfollowing characteristics:  \r\n• Robustness —the ability to keep operating in the  face of disaster. It translates into \r\ndesigning structures or s ystems to be strong enough or devising substitute or \r\nredundant systems to maintain operations. Robustness also entails investing in \r\nand maintaining elements of critical infrastructure to withst and low -probability but \r\nhigh-consequence events.  \r\n• Adaptability —the ability to absorb new lessons that can be drawn from a \r\ncatastrophe. It involves revising plans, modifying procedures, and introducing \r\nnew tools and technologies to improve robustness, resou rcefulness and recovery \r\ncapabilities before the next crisis.  \r\n• Resourcefulness —the ability to skillfully manage a disaster as it unfolds. It   \r\nincludes identifying options, prioritizing what should be done both to control \r\ndamage and to mitigate it, and commu nicating decisions for implementation. \r\nResourcefulness depends primarily on people, not technology. Resourcefulness \r\nalso includes the ability to cope if a key resource such as backup power \r\nbecomes inoperable.  \r\n• Rapid Recovery —the capacity to get systems back  to normal as quickly as \r\npossible after a disaster. Carefully drafted contingency plans, competent \r\nemergency operations to get the appropriate manpower and resources to the \r\nright places are crucial. This may mean getting only critical systems up and \r\nrunnin g quickly while less critical systems can be slower to recover.  \r\n2.2. General Site Information  \r\n73, 111, 113 , and 136 Spadina are all unoccupied  residential properties with the \r\nfollowing  particulars:  \r\n• 73 Spadina Road: Semi-detached three -story  with basement built in the \r\n1920s with a total area of approximately 2,550 square feet  \r\n• 111 Spadina Road: Semi -detached three -story with basement built in the \r\n1920s with a total area of approximately 4,760 square feet  \r\n• 113 Spadina Road: Semi -detached three -story with basement built in the \r\n1920s with a total area of approximately  3,000 square feet  \r\n• 136 Spadina Road: Detached three -story with basement built in the 1920s \r\nwith a total area of approximately 2,630 square feet  \r\n• The total floor area for all four (4) sites is 12,940 square feet  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n3 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3. Procedures  \r\nReview available documents and perform site visits to identify opportunities for emission \r\nreduction and resilience measures.  \r\n \r\n2.4. Utility billing data  \r\nReview three years of utility b illing data for each location for all energy sources; natural \r\ngas, propane, diesel, heating oil, electricity, district heating and cooling.  \r\n \r\n2.5. Document review  \r\nReview available documents. (Drawings, Building Condition Assessments, \r\nspecifications, OEM manuals, and service records) The City will provide all available \r\nrelated documents and drawings to the Consultant for reference only. It shall be the \r\nConsultant\'s responsibility to verify through site visits that existing systems confo rm to \r\navailable documents and drawings, or to record deviations. Key drawings or other \r\ndocuments may be missing, and cannot be relied on to be accurate even when they are \r\navailable. Revising the City\'s drawings or documents is outside the scope of the \r\ncontract. \r\n \r\n2.6. Site surveys  \r\nPerform site visits to verify and complement drawings, documents and data. Interview \r\nbuilding operators and occupants. Review operation and maintenance procedures. \r\nCollect equipment set points, operating schedules, and photos of namepla tes. Tour the \r\nland that the facility resides on. Identify neighbouring facilities.  \r\nEstimate insulation level (R -value) of existing envelope components. Where wall and \r\nceiling cavities cannot be adequately inspected through existing openings, the \r\nConsultant  shall remove electrical cover plates, baseboards, and/or ceiling panels to \r\nidentify insulation. If cavities cannot be adequately inspected by removing these covers, \r\nthe Consultant shall drill a ¼\" hole and inspect with a borescope. If asbestos is present \r\nor suspected, the City will provide the consultant with the Safe Working Procedure for \r\nthe work. More invasive inspections are beyond the scope of this contract, but the \r\nConsultant should flag remaining uncertainties and may recommend further inspections \r\nin the report. Do not disturb piping insulation. Covering must be reinstalled and holes \r\nmust be patched.  \r\n \r\n2.7. Fair Wage Policy  \r\nThe provisions of the Fair Wage Policy apply equally to contractors and all sub -\r\ncontractors engaged in work for the City of Toronto.   Specifically, drilling and repair work \r\nthat may be required for insulation investigation, will also be subject to the City\'s Fair \r\nWage policy. The Fair Wage Office administers the Fair Wage  Policy that prohibits the \r\nCity from doing business with contractor s and suppliers who discriminate against their \r\nworkers.  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n4 \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Fair Wage Office investigates complaints and takes enforcement action when it is \r\ndetermined that a contractor has failed to pay its workers the prescribed fair wage or \r\nhas not abided by the labou r trade contractual obligations in the construction industry \r\n(collective agreements).  \r\nThe Fair Wage Policy and Fair Wage Schedules can be found at the following website:  \r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/fairwage   \r\nIt is the responsibility of the successful bidder to familiarize themselves with the City of \r\nToronto\'s Fair Wage Policy and City of Toronto\'s labour trade contractual obligations in \r\nthe construction industry (collective agreements) that apply to this work. The successful \r\nbidder must commit to abide by the City of Toronto\'s Fair Wage Policy and la bour trade \r\ncontractual obligations in the construction industry.  \r\nIt is the  responsibility of the successful bidder to ensure that work performed in \r\nconnection with the insulation investigation will be performed by a worker belonging to \r\nthe appropriate labour trade union and/or the appropriate wage rate from the \r\nappropriate wage schedule is applied.  \r\nIn the event that other Fair Wage Schedules may overlap the work covered by this \r\nContract or if you have any questions with respect to the Fair Wage Policy or the Fair \r\nWage Schedules please contact the Fair Wage Office by:  \r\n• Tel: (416 ) 392 -7300  \r\n• Fax:(416) 392 -0801  \r\n• E-Mail: fairwage@toronto.ca  \r\n \r\n2.8. Asbestos  \r\nAsbestos may become airborne if disturbed, and is hazardous if inhaled. Asbestos was \r\nextensively used in Canadian building materials until 1980, before being phased out to a \r\nnearly complete ban in 2018. Of particular importance to this scope, it was commonly \r\nfound in drywall panels, plaster, and insulatio n. The City will provide the Consultant with \r\nthe most recent Designated S ubstances Survey for this site and guidance regarding \r\nsafe work procedures in the presence of suspected or confirmed asbestos. The \r\nConsultant is responsible for providing appropriate safety training, safety equipment, \r\nand safe working procedures to their s taff, in accordance with the City\'s asbestos \r\nmanagement  policy and designated substances policy.   \r\n \r\n2.9. Project Me etings and Scheduling  \r\nThe Consultant is to provide a detailed breakdown work plan of the project scope of \r\nwork and schedule within two (2) weeks after award for review and approval by the City.  \r\nThe schedule is to be updated monthly, and reviewed with the City\'s Project Manager.  \r\nChanges to the project schedule require a written explanation and must be approved, in \r\nwriting, by the City.  \r\nThe Consultant shall be responsible for the preparation of agendas and minutes for the \r\nmeetings and shall ensure that these are prepared and submitted to attendees within \r\none (1) week prior to and after meetings, respectively.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n5 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.2. Zero Emission Study  \r\n2.2.1.  Objective  \r\nThe Zero Emission study explores different combinations of emission reduction \r\nmeasures (ERMs), energy conservation m easure s (ECM), and fuel switching options \r\nthat could achieve a net -zero emission building while minimizing costs. A net -zero \r\nemissions build ing is one that is highly energy -efficient and produces onsite, or \r\nprocures, carbon -free and/or renewable energy in an amount sufficient to offset the \r\nannual carbon emissions associated with its operations or simply eliminates carbon \r\nemissions altogether. Off -site carbon offsets are permitted as the last resort, but the \r\nconsultant must provide the rationale for this dec ision and demonstrate that all other \r\noptions have been investigated and eliminated . The Zero Emission study is similar in \r\nnature to an ASHRAE 211 Level 2 energy audit. The Zero Emissions study requires air \r\ntightness testing, insulation assessment and build ing energy modelling; these are also \r\nroutine elements of a level 2 energy audit according to ASHRAE  211 sections \r\n5.4.5.2(n), 6.2.1.2 an d 5.4.5.3(b) respectively. The Zero Emission study differs from \r\ntraditional energy audits in its emphasis on deep emissio n reductions as opposed to \r\nmarginal cost reductions. Deep emission reduction measures generally have strong \r\ninteractive effects which must be taken into account, even though this is normally left to \r\na level 3 audit. The Study will bundle measures together into four scenarios for analysis \r\nof emissions and life cycle costs.  \r\n \r\n2.2.2.  Deliverables  \r\nThe Study will produce the following deliverables:  \r\n1. A summary report  for each location , including the following sections at a \r\nminimum:  \r\na. Executive Summary  \r\nb. Introduction  \r\nc. Building Description  \r\nd. Assessment of challenges and opportunities  \r\ne. Assessment of challenges and opportunities including, but not limited to:  \r\ni. Analysis of supply temperature  \r\nii. Analysis of ground heat exchanger potential  \r\niii. Electrical service capacity and upgrade limitations  \r\niv. Other emission reduction and energy conservation measures  \r\nf. Summary of Four Scenarios  \r\ng. Net Zero Transition Plan  \r\nh. Summary of financial performance of the four scenarios  \r\ni. Recommendation  \r\n2. Solar PV design software report  \r\n3. Ground heat ex changer design software report  \r\n4. Energy modelling simulation files for each of the four scenarios  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n6 \r\n \r\n \r\n5. A financial analysis spreadsheet comparing the four scenarios  \r\n6. One-page business case for net zero emission scenario  \r\nThe Study draft report s are submitted to City of Toronto Project Manager and circulated \r\nto the CREM staff for review. Even though the report may have a \"draft\" status, it must \r\npass the Consultant\'s quality assurance processes and be free from serious technical \r\nerrors before being su bmitted to the City. Comments will be provided on the level of \r\nsatisfaction with the report contents and conclusions before the report is to be finalized.  \r\nThe energy modelling files will be reviewed by an energy modelling expert for \r\nreasonableness and cali bration accuracy.  \r\n \r\n2.2.3.  Measure Assessment  \r\nIdentify an initial list of emission reduction measures (ERMs) that have the best \r\npotential to contribute towards a net zero emission building. ERMs tend to have strong \r\ninteractive effect, so there is no expectation to evaluate the costs and emission savings \r\nof individual measures. Costs and savings will be modelled for groupings of measures \r\ncalled scenarios.  \r\nThe specific ERMs discussed in the sections below must be assessed, unless the City \r\napproves their  exclusion. The Geoexchange, District Heating and Biofuels assessments \r\nare not needed if ALL of the following are true:  \r\n• 100% of the TEDI is already supplied by some combination of these heat \r\nsources  \r\n• All biofuels in use already meet the eligibility criteria  of the CaGBC Zero Carbon \r\nBuilding Design Standard v3 for zero emission biofuels  \r\n• All district heating meets ONE of the following requirements:  \r\no the CaGBC NZB Design v3 definition of \"Green Heat\", OR  \r\no the owner has published a transition plan to remove combus tion \r\n• Building comfort complies with ASHRAE 55  \r\n2.2.4.  Supply temperature  \r\nIdentify make and model of existing air handling units, fan coils, radiators, and \r\ncirculation pumps. Collect specifications, or, if unavailable or modified, estimate \r\ncapacities and supply tem perature requirements.  The Consultant shall review radiators, \r\nfan coils, air handling units, heat exchangers, pumps, pipe sizes and duct sizes to \r\ndetermine the minimum supply temperature that would allow the existing heat \r\ndistribution system to meet the de sign heating load. Identify  limiting components. \r\nEstimate costs and space requirements that may be needed for upgrades that would \r\nlower the minimum supply temperature.  The Consultant must explore options to reduce \r\nthe supply temperature well below the maxi mum supply temperature of r elevant heat \r\npumps, since heat pumps are heavily derated at high supply temperatures. Review floor \r\nlayout and ceiling height to assess the impacts and costs of installing a hydronic radiant \r\nheated floors. Determine whether or not  a structural analysis woul d be warranted, but \r\nstructural analysis is not part of this scope of work. Determine if heritage registration of \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n7 \r\n \r\n \r\nthe building may constrain radiant floor, radiator or fan coil design.  If the system uses \r\nsteam distribution, the S tudy must estimate the costs  of converting to warm water \r\ndistribution.  \r\n \r\n2.2.5.  Waste heat recovery  \r\nIdentify opportunities for waste heat recovery. Identify opportunities that may exist from \r\nor to nearby facilities.  \r\n \r\n2.2.6.  Geoexchange  \r\nQuantify land area that could be used for geoexchange trenches, wells, or pond loops. \r\nDescribe the current surface covering (parking lot, cultivated flowers, etc.) over likely \r\nsites. Evaluate accessibility for drilling or trenching equipment, which may inc lude the \r\nutilization of bringing miniature drilling equipment into the building basement or rear lots.  \r\nThe Consultant shall make a reasonable effort to flag possible subsurface issues with \r\ndrilling at the site.  \r\nAfter review of site layout, site access, an d subsurface issues, evaluate the potential \r\ncapacity of a plausible ground heat exchanger design. Consider opportunities for \r\nvertical, horizontal or submerged heat exchangers. Ground heat exchanger sizing shall \r\nbe done with Ground Loop Design (GLD) , Earth Energy Designer (EED) , Ground Loop \r\nHeat Exchanger Design GLHEPRO  or Looplink Pro . Provide the software report as an \r\nattachment to the study. If open land area is inadequate, consider directional drilling or \r\ndrilling from the basement. If the potential capacity of a vertical ground heat exchanger \r\nis insufficient to meet building loads, identify opportunities to improve system balance.  \r\nIf a geoexchange system is selected for inclusion in one or more of the scenarios, \r\nprovide a layout for the proposed borefield, trenching and connection points, including \r\ndepth indications and pipe diameters. Identify environmental or navigation impacts that \r\nmay constrain submerged heat exchanger design.  \r\n \r\n2.2.7.  District heating system  \r\nIf a district ene rgy system exists in the area, evaluate the energy, cost, and GHG \r\nimpacts of connecting to it. If a district energy system is planned in the area, and the \r\nPayback scenario does not achieve zero GHGI, that scenario must comply with the City \r\nof Toronto\'s Design Guideline for District Energy -Ready Buildings  to ensure that future \r\nconnection is not precluded by this retrofit. The other scenario s may include a district \r\nheating connection, but need not be district energy -ready.  \r\nIf any scenario includes district heating or cooling, recommend specific additional \r\nequipment or modifications needed to enable monitoring of steam, chilled water, and \r\nhot water flows from t he utility. Identify any data format obsolescence or interface \r\nobsolescence risks with existing equipment. Include new or replacement equipment \r\ncosts in the capital costs of each scenario where district heating or cooling is present, \r\nincluding the Baseline scenario.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n8 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.2.8.  Biofuels  \r\nWhere biofuels sources are available on site in substantial quantities, consider \r\nopportunities for direct use of landfill gas, sewer gas, sewage heat recovery, or waste \r\nwood.  \r\n \r\n2.2.9.  Demand heating  \r\nAssess opportunities for l ocalized on -demand heating in zones with sparse or \r\nintermittent occupancy.  \r\n \r\n2.2.10.  Electrical peak demand  \r\nDetermine the capacity of existing electrical service. Identify limiting components. \r\nEstimate costs and space requirements that may be needed to upgrade ele ctrical \r\nservice to levels needed for building electrification while continuing to support existing \r\nvehicle chargers. Separately estimate the incremental cost to support J1772 (level 2) \r\nchargers for 25% of regular parking spaces and 100% of service vehicle bays, but do \r\nnot include in any of the four scenarios.  \r\nIdentify opportunities to shape demand to keep it within existing peak capacity limits, or \r\nto provide demand response capacity to the grid.  This may include shaping the setpoint \r\nschedule, sizing buffe r tanks, scheduling DHW production, or controlling vehicle \r\nchargers.  \r\nThe Consultant must at least assess the potential to use an oversized buffer tank or \r\nother thermal storage to shift a significant portion of electrical loads away from peak \r\ntime-of-use h ours. Either water tank or phase -change materials may be considered, \r\ndepending on space availability.  \r\n \r\n2.2.11.  Air infiltration  \r\nQuantify envelope air leakage through testing and locate dominant leaks. See Toronto \r\nGreen Standard non -mandatory Guidance Document on Air Tightness Testing Protocol \r\n& Process . Testing methods may be adapted to the particular constraints and logistics \r\nof each building. Us ing the building\'s existing ventilation system for the test per CGSB - \r\nCAN/CGSB -149.10 -M86 is permissible if a pressure difference of at least 50 Pa can be \r\nachieved. Tracer gas tests per ASTM E 1186 may be permissible subject to City \r\napproval of the tracer  gas quantity, global warming potential, and cost savings. Guarded \r\nairtightness testing may be performed where it is easier than full building testing, and \r\nareas with low human occupancy may be excluded.  \r\nPropose approaches for sealing identified air leaks,  or for a general upgrade in air \r\ntightness.  \r\n \r\n2.2.12.  Solar panels  \r\nAssess the feasibility of solar system installation (both photovoltaic (PV) and thermal) \r\non the roof and walls of the building, windows (Building -Integrated solar PV - BIPV) and \r\nthe grounds, for exa mple solar carport over the parking lot/garage. For analysis please \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n9 \r\n \r\n \r\nuse a minimum of 400W solar PV panels placed at 10 degree angle on rooftop and \r\ncarport systems. Determine whether or not a structural analysis is warranted, but \r\nstructural analysis is not part of this scope of work. Determine if electrical service \r\ncapacity or heritage registration of the building may constrain the solar design.  \r\nConduct a long -term shading study incorporating existing and permitted building heights \r\nand other obstructions to the southeast, south and southwest of the site.  \r\nProvide an estimate of the maximum PV system size, and system production using \r\naccepted industry solar PV design software. ( PVSyst  and Helioscope  are preferred) \r\nProvide the software report as an attachment to the study.  \r\nProvide preliminary layout of the potential system taking into account the set -back from \r\nthe property edge and shading (for ground systems) and roof edges, mech anical \r\nequipment, and green roof requirements (for roof based systems).  \r\n \r\n2.2.13.  Conventional measures  \r\nEvaluate the potential of the following energy conservation measures to reduce \r\nemissions and improve payback, or provide reasons for not recommending them:  \r\n• Interior and exterior lighting retrofits  \r\n• demand control ventilation  \r\n• water conservation strategies  \r\n• roof insulation upgrade to EnerPHit or CaGBC prescriptive standards  \r\n• window upgrades to triple pane  \r\n• resistive electrical heating  \r\n• air source heat pumps  \r\n• decommissioning of combined heat and power systems  \r\n2.2.14.  Scenarios  \r\nAssemble ERMs and ECMs into four scenarios and build an energy model for each  \r\nlocation : \r\n1. Baseline Scenario: purchase of emission offsets instead of modifying the \r\nbuilding  \r\n2. Simple Scenario: deep emi ssion reductions at low capital costs  \r\n3. Zero Emission Scenario: reducing emissions as much as reasonably \r\nachievable  \r\n4. Payback Scenario: using energy savings to pay for emission reductions  \r\nTypical bundles of measures are provided in the definition of each scena rio for \r\nillustration only. The Consultant must apply sound engineering judgement to select a \r\nreasonable bundle of measures that fit the definition of each scenario. Develop energy \r\nmodels for all four scenarios. Provide a Class D costing analysis and life c ycle cost \r\nanalysis of each scenario. Provide advice on design and pricing allowances for items \r\nnot yet known, as well as risk allowances.  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n10 \r\n \r\n \r\nLimited combustion is permitted in each scenario as follows:  \r\n Baseline  Simple  Zero Payback  \r\nNew or replacement natural gas equipment      \r\nLife extension of existing natural gas \r\nequipment  ✓   ✓ \r\nOn-site electricity generation from fossil \r\nfuels  ✓   ✓ \r\nBiofuels with LULUCF emissions  ✓ ✓  ✓ \r\nBiofuels with zero emissions  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ \r\nEmergency fossil fuel generators for power \r\noutages  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ \r\n ✓= Allowed    = Forbidden  \r\nNone of the scenarios may include any new or replacement natural gas, propane or \r\ndiesel equipment. Some scenarios may include life extension measures such as boiler \r\ntube replacement or overhaul of combined heat and power systems, but not boiler \r\nreplacement . If biofuels are used in any scenario, emissions from land use, land use \r\nchange, and forestry (LULUCF) must be included in GHG calculations, unless they \r\nmeet the eligibi lity criteria of the CaGBC Zero Carbon Building Design Standard v3 for \r\nzero emission biofuels.  \r\n \r\n2.2.15.  Baseline Scenario  \r\nThe Baseline Scenario is composed of the minimal state -of-good -repair (SOGR) \r\nmeasures needed to keep the building operational. Major SOGR measures should be \r\nassumed to meet the minimum prescriptive requirements of the Ontario Building Code \r\nsupplementary standard SB -10. This may incidentally produce energy or emission \r\nimprovements relative to historical performance. For example, if the roof i s leaking and \r\nneeds replacement, the new roof should be assumed to come with improved insulation \r\nto meet SB -10. However, the baseline scenario excludes any measure intended \r\nprimarily to conserve energy or reduce emissions, such as extra roof insulation to meet \r\nEnerPHit or CaGBC standards.  \r\n \r\n2.2.16.  Simple Scenario  \r\nThe Simple Scenario is composed of measures needed to eliminate on -site combustion \r\nof fossil fuels at minimum capital costs. For most facilities, this would mean replacing all \r\non-site natural gas equipment  with resistive electric equivalents, such as electric boilers, \r\nelectric baseboards, electric water heaters, electric dryers, electric stoves, etc., \r\ncombined with enough electricity conservation measures to mitigate the need for \r\nservice capacity upgrades. Alternatively, this may mean connecting to an existing \r\ndistrict heating system, or switching to biofuels, if this can be done at a lower capital \r\ncost than a resistive electrical retrofit.  \r\nThe Simple Scenario should include any measures that lower overall c apital costs \r\nwithout increasing emissions. The Simple Scenario should also include any electricity \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n11 \r\n \r\n \r\nconservation measure with a simple payback period of one year or less, including the \r\ncost of clean electricity offsets in the calculation.  \r\n2.2.17.  Zero Emission Sce nario  \r\nThe Zero Emission Scenario is composed of all measures needed to bring the building \r\nin compliance with one of the following two standards:  \r\n• Passive House Institute EnerPHit , Classic rating or better; or  \r\n• CaGBC Zero Carbon Building Design Standard  v3 \r\nNote: Do not confuse the CaGBC Performance standard, which applie s to all scenarios, \r\nwith the Design standard, which only applies to the Zero Emission scenario.  \r\nEach standard offers multiple compliance pathways or options. The Consultant is \r\nexpected to select the standard and pathway that would, in their judgement, requ ire the \r\nleast effort for modelling and costing, even if that may not result in the lowest \r\nconstr uction cost. The study must state which standard was chosen, and which \r\ncompliance pathway or options were chosen.  \r\nThe study must consider ASHP, GSHP, and resis tive electric heating options in \r\nsufficient detail to determine which option is likely to have the shortest Simple Payback \r\nPeriod, and incorporate that option into the Zero Emission Scenario. That comparison \r\nmust consider differences in maintenance costs a nd clean electricity offset costs.  \r\nBiofuels such as renewable natural gas or biomass must meet the eligibility criteria of \r\nthe CaGBC Zero Carbon Building Design Standard v3 for zero emission biofuels. \r\nExisting biofuel systems that do not comply must be rep laced. Existing district energy \r\nsystems must be replaced, unless they meet the CaGBC\'s definition of Green Heat or \r\nthe owner has published a transition plan to eliminate combustion.  \r\n \r\n2.2.18.  Payback Scenario  \r\nThe Payback Scenario is composed of a blend of ECMs and ERMs that minimizes \r\nGHGI while providing a simple payback period of 30 years or less relative to the \r\nBaseline Scenario. If a GHGI of zero may be achieved with a simple payback period of \r\n30 years or less, select a grouping of measures to minimize payback pe riod while \r\nkeeping a GHGI of zero.  \r\nFor most facilities, the Payback scenario is typically expected to include the following \r\nfeatures:  \r\n• all electricity conservation measures that have a simple payback period shorter \r\nthan 30 years  \r\n• as much solar photovoltaic g eneration as the site will allow  \r\n• a selection of the envelope upgrades considered in the Zero Emissions scenario  \r\n• a combination of ASHP, GSHP, and district heating to supply most of TEDI  \r\n• supplementary heating for the coldest days of winter  \r\nThe Consultant must apply sound engineering judgment to select a reasonable bundle \r\nof measures that fits the scenario definition.  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n12 \r\n \r\n \r\nIdentify any data format obsolescence or interface obsolescence risks with existing \r\nequipment.  \r\n \r\n2.2.19.  Energy Modelling  \r\nDevelop a buildi ng energy model for each scenario. Use the energy model to calculate \r\nTEDI, annual electricity consumption, annual natural gas consumption, and annual \r\nelectricity generation of each scenario. Any difference of more than ±10% between the \r\nBaseline model annua l utility consumption and the historical annual consumption from \r\nbilling data must be explained. Calculate Energy Use Intensity (EUI) and Greenhouse \r\nGas Intensity (GHGI). For most buildings, EUI and GHGI calculations may be calculated \r\nfrom utility consumpt ion in the Excel financial analysis template provided by the City.  \r\nThe electronic simulation files must be provided as attachments to the study. Report \r\nvalues in the following units:  \r\n• TEDI and EUI in units of kWh/m²/y  \r\n• GHGI in units of kgCO ₂e/m²/y  \r\n• Annual ele ctricity consumption and generation in units of kWh or MWh  \r\n• Annual natural gas consumption in units of m³  \r\n• Annual emissions in units of tCO ₂e/m²/y, where t is a metric ton (1,000 kg)  \r\nThe energy model may be built in RETScreen Expert  software using the Feasibility \r\nanalysis type, or detailed calculations may be provided in well documented Excel \r\nspreadsheets. Regression models built in the R ETScreen Performan ce analysis type \r\nare not adequate. The Consultant may propose alternative software instead of \r\nRETScreen, subject to t he City\'s approval. Calibrate the model against historical billing \r\ndata for all energy sources. The model should be able to reproduce at le ast three years \r\nof annual consumption to within ±10%. Provide a graph showing monthly modelled and \r\nactual historical consumption over a typical year for comparison. Predictions of future \r\nconsumption only need to be made on an annual basis, not monthly.  \r\nOn-site generation or cogeneration from fuels need not be modelled in RETScreen. \r\nOutdoor heating or snow melting need not be modelled in RETScreen. Supplement the \r\nRETScreen building model with separate engineering calculations for the scenarios \r\nwhere these  features are present.  \r\n \r\n2.2.20.  Zero Carbon Transition Plan  \r\nPropose a reasonable cost -effective sequence and timing of renovations to eliminate \r\non-site carbon emissions by 2040, and to eventually remove any remaining biofuel \r\ncombustion and district heating off -site emissions beyond 2040. The plan should be \r\ninformed by the analysis results of the four scenarios, but need not correspond precisely \r\nto any of them. Renovations should generally be timed to coincide with the end of \r\nservice life of existing equipment, but consideration must be given to transient \r\nconditions between retrofits.  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n13 \r\n \r\n \r\nSet out a realistic design -build approach and a distribution of capital investments over \r\ntime. Identify periods of time when operations must be reduced or relocated due to \r\nconstruction . Describe natural intervention points, such as the anticipated end of life of \r\nmechanical equipment or necessary SOGR renovations. A critical question that the \r\nZero Carbon Transition Plan must examine is whether to pursue electrification first or \r\nefficienc y first, and what to do in the interim. Consider the limits imposed by electrical \r\nservice capacity and regulated phase -out timeline of refrigerants. Consider data \r\ncollection opportunities that could help control future costs. Explain the reasoning \r\nbehind t he choices made.  \r\nThe proposed 2040 state of the building must not have any on -site combustion of fossil \r\nfuels, except for intermittent emissions from back -up systems that are only used in \r\npower outages, emergencies and occasional testing. If the proposed 2 040 state of the \r\nbuilding includes zero emission biofuels, describe the reasons why. Include in the \r\ntransition plan the cost and timeline to remove biofuel combustion beyond 2040.  \r\nDescribe how heating loads will be reduced. Describe the mechanical HVAC st rategy \r\nand how components of the system will be adapted to accommodate non -combustion -\r\nbased technologies. Describe measures to facilitate the conversion to non -combustion -\r\nbased technologies, such as designing the HVAC system to use low -temperature \r\ndistribu tion or allocating space for renewable or electrical -sourced heating technologies. \r\n(e.g., heat pumps)  \r\n \r\n2.2.21.  Financial Analysis  \r\nProvide a Class D costing analysis of each scenario, comprised of an elemental \r\nsummary and based on rough costs per square metre. Break out the capital costs in the \r\nfollowing categories:  \r\n1. HVAC upgrades  \r\n2. Renewable energy generation  \r\n3. Envelope enhancement upgrades  \r\n4. Commissioning, including post -retrofit air tightness testing if envelope is \r\nupgraded  \r\nProvide advice on design and pricin g allowances for items not yet known, as well as risk \r\nallowances. Identify applicable incentives from the provincial or federal governments or \r\nfrom utilities or private sources. Flag conditions and deadlines that must be met in order \r\nfor the measure to be eligible. Estimate incentive amount and include in the financial \r\nanalysis as part of the study.  \r\nProvide life cycle cost analyses of the four retrofit scenarios in a Microsoft Excel \r\nspreadsheet attached to the report. The spreadsheet must show and label the  capital \r\ncosts, incentives, annual energy savings and annual greenhouse gas reductions of \r\neach scenario, and use these as inputs to the financial analysis.  \r\nIf the facility could qualify as a Class A electricity customer and the scenario includes \r\nmeasures to curtail demand to participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative, \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n14 \r\n \r\n \r\nannual electricity costs may be calculated with energy modelling software instead of \r\nExcel formulas. The energy modelling files must be provided to the City.  \r\nAn Excel workbook temp late is available from the City, which may provide a starting \r\npoint. However, the Consultant is responsible for verifying whether the template \r\ncalculations are applicable to the scenarios being studied, and for modifying the \r\nworkbook as required. Informati on about situations requiring customization are provided \r\nin the template.  \r\nThe financial analysis of all four scenarios will model the purchase of offset credits \r\nequal to any residual emissions so as to comply with the CaGBC Zero Carbon Building \r\nPerformance Standard . Do not confuse the Performance standard, which applies to all \r\nscenarios, with the Design standard, w hich only applies to the Zero Emission scenario.  \r\nThe City will provide utility rate forecasts, discount rates, time horizon and cost schedule \r\nof high quality carbon offsets. Obtain emission intensity factors for Ontario from \r\nEnvironment Canada\'s most rec ent National Inventory Report. Report these values and \r\nall other emission factors in the spreadsheet and cite the source. All scenarios must use \r\nthe utility rates forecast by the City, including biofuels, and must assume the purchase \r\nof high quality carbon  offsets equal to net building emissions, including emissions from \r\noff-site generation of electricity, steam and hot water. (i.e. ISO 14064 scope 2)  \r\nEncode Excel formulas to calculate, for each scenario, the simple payback period, \r\n(SPP) the 20 -year net pre sent value (NPV) in accordance with ASTM E 917 , and the \r\n20-year internal rate of return (IRR) in accordance with ASTM E 1057 . Calculate \r\ncumulativ e scope 2 GHG emissions from present day to 2040 for all four scenarios, \r\nusing methods in compliance with ISO 14064 Part 2 . \r\n \r\n2.2.22.  Business Case  \r\nDevelop a one -page stand -alone business case for Net Zero Emi ssions scenario, \r\nstructured for rapid reading and formatted to draw attention. Include non -monetary \r\nbenefits such as improved control  of airborne infections and thermal comfort. Use the \r\nsame assumptions and financial metrics as in the financial analysis ab ove. \r\n \r\n2.2.23.  Recommendation  \r\nBased on the completed analysis, state a preferred scenario. The City\'s preferred \r\nscenario is the Net Zero Emission scenario by default, but the Consultant may \r\nrecommend a different scenario if unusual conditions make this scenario unreasonable. \r\nProvide recommendations and next steps to facilitate decarbonization.  \r\n  \r\n2.3. Climate Change Resilience Assessment  \r\n2.3.1.  Objective  \r\nThe Climate Change Resiliency Assessment evaluates an individual building\'s exposure \r\nand vulnerability to climate change, take an inventory of its resiliency features, and \r\nidentify opport unities for improvement. City services at this location will rely on building \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n15 \r\n \r\n \r\nresilience, but operational resilience of those services is beyond the scope of this \r\nassessment.  \r\nThe CCRA is not an emergency plan. Emergency plans and equipment are a basic \r\nrequirement for all buildings, but the CCRA is intended look further to the building\'s \r\ncapacity to support continuity of all City services to the public, in spite of increasingly \r\nfrequent and prolonged climate disruptions. This includes, for example, cultural and \r\nrecreational services.  \r\nComplete self -sufficiency and indestructability are unrealistic objectives for resilience. \r\nService continuity can be maintained in spite of individual a sset losses so long as \r\nsufficient redundancy and capacity exists city -wide. This assessment is intended to \r\nevaluate the site\'s potential contributions and demands towards city -wide resilience in \r\nthe face of climate disruptions. Consideration includes irrep laceable cultural, historical \r\nor environmentally significant aspects of a building or its contents.  \r\n \r\n2.3.2.  Deliverables  \r\nThe Assessment will produce a report  for each location  including the following sections \r\nat minimum  as applicable to the site : \r\n1. Executive Summary  \r\n2. Introduction  \r\n3. General Description  \r\n4. Exposure  \r\n5. Vulnerability  \r\n6. Resilience Upgrades Less Than $5,000  \r\n7. Capital Upgrades for Resilience  \r\nAll recommended measures shall be tabulated with schedules and cost.  \r\nThe Study draft report s are submitted to City of Toronto Project Manager and circulated \r\nto the CREM staff for review. Even though the report may have a \"draft\" status, it must \r\npass the Consultant\'s quality assurance processes and be free from serious technical \r\nerrors befo re being submitted to the City. Comments will be provided on the level of \r\nsatisfaction with the report contents and conclusions before the report is to be finalized.  \r\n \r\n2.3.3.  Exposure  \r\nAssess th e nature and degree to which each  facility is exposed to climate disrup tions by \r\nvirtue of its geographical location, size and orientation. Extreme weather events are \r\nusually best described by intensity -duration -frequency curves rather than singular \r\nprobabilities for arbitrary thresholds.  \r\n \r\n2.3.4.  Climate projections  \r\nCite the climate projection data selected to inform this resilience assessment. This may \r\ninclude but need not cover all or be limited to the following resources:  \r\n• Ontario Climate Data Portal: https://lamps.mat h.yorku.ca/OntarioClimate/  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n16 \r\n \r\n \r\n• Ontario Climate Change Data Portal http://ontarioccdp.ca/  \r\n• Canadian Centre for Climate Services https://www.canada.ca/en/environment -\r\nclimate -change/services/climate -change/canadian -centre -climate -services.html  \r\n• Climate Data for a Resilient Canada: https:/climatedata.ca/   \r\n• The Climate Atlas of Canada: https://climateatlas.ca/   \r\n• Ontario Ministry of Transportation IDF Curve Lookup: \r\nhttp://www.mto.gov.on.ca/IDF_Curves/terms.shtml  \r\nhttp://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~dprincz/mto_site/terms.shtml  \r\nMost climate change parameters can be assumed to be the  same across the entire City. \r\nThis assessment may simply cite the sources where these parameters are documented \r\ninstead of duplicating them in this assessment.  \r\n \r\n2.3.5.  Overland flooding  \r\nAssess the future  overland flooding risk for each  property. Report the distance and \r\nelevation of the site above the nearest body of water. Provide topographic, permeability, \r\nand floodplain maps of  the surrounding neighbourhood. The Consultant may use the \r\nfollowing resource s or equivalent alternatives:  \r\n• Land Information Ontario https://www.ontario.ca/page/land -information -ontario   \r\n• ArcGIS Online Land Permeability in Toronto \r\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2fb8d13f06f841c3b0aa505e2f98d646   \r\n• Toronto and Region Conservation Authority Flood Plain Map \r\nhttps://trca.ca/conservation/flood -risk-management/flood -plain -map-viewer/  \r\nInvestigate if property is located within an area that has been or come near to being \r\nflooded due to ice jams. Gauge the possibility, based on surrounding slo pes, that \r\noverland inflows could exceed outflows during extreme rainfall events. Locate nearby \r\nstorm drains. Make reasonable efforts to establish historical high water levels in the \r\narea.  Flood modeling is outside the scope of this study.  \r\n \r\n2.3.6.  Ground stability  \r\nAssess future  ground stability risks for each  property, given the potential for extreme \r\nrainfall and other climate disruptions. If the property is near an eroding shore or cliff \r\nsuch as the Scarborough Bluffs, estimate how long the building may r emain safe. \r\nSuggests thresholds that should trigger re -evaluation.  \r\n \r\n2.3.7.  Wind exposure  \r\nEvaluate the wind exposure factor in accordance with the current version of the National \r\nBuilding Code of Canada and Ontario Building Code. Use current versions of the codes , \r\nnot the version in effect at time of construction.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n17 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.8.  Pests  \r\nAssess local prevalence of pests. Agricultural pests are beyond the scope of this \r\nassessment.  \r\n \r\n2.3.9.  Vulnerability  \r\nAssess pre -existing weaknesses that risk collapse under the pressures of climate \r\nchange . Vulnerabilities are generally not caused by climate change. They are typically a \r\nsource of risk or nuisance even before being aggravated by climate change.  \r\n \r\n2.3.10.  Flood  \r\nIdentify any equipment and structures that are located below grade, or within possible \r\nflood levels projected by the \"Exposure\" section. Include both primary and back -up \r\nsystems in this assessment. Include sump pumps. Assess the effectiveness of \r\nwaterproof ing features in place.  \r\n \r\n2.3.11.  Drought  \r\nIdentify any equipment and structures that rely on minimum water levels for operation. \r\nEstimate the water level that would degrade performance. Record if the building\'s \r\nservice lines from the water main contain lead; if the y do, the assessment must note \r\nthat lead concentrations could increase if flow is reduced by water conservation \r\nmeasures.  \r\n \r\n2.3.12.  Drainage  \r\nCheck and record the presence of sewage backflow prevention, drains, sumps, grading, \r\nand catch basins on site. Review drawin gs to look for presence of buried components. \r\nAssess their condition and capacity if applicable and accessible. Review maintenance \r\nschedules and records.  \r\n \r\n2.3.13.  Snow and ice  \r\nIf a flat roof or low -pitch roof is present, search design and maintenance documents to \r\nestablish the weight capacity of the roof. Engineering calculations are beyond the scope \r\nof this assessment, but may be recommended by this assessment. Search for roof \r\ndepressions, ceiling sag, truss sag, drywall cracks, water stains or structural shifts that \r\nmay indicate past overloading of the roof. Identify rooftop vents and intakes that may be \r\nburied by extreme snowfall and assess possible failure modes. Assess the c ondition \r\nand effectiveness of roof drainage and heat tracing on roof drains.  \r\n \r\n2.3.14.  Impingement  \r\nIdentify any exposed assets that may suffer damage in hail, freezing rain, heavy snow \r\naccumulation, high winds carrying debris, or periods of civil unrest. Graffiti and broken \r\nwindows are not material to this assessment, but some statues and antennae may be \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n18 \r\n \r\n \r\nconsidered vulnerable. Document radomes or other protections in place. Watch for soft \r\nor porous materials that may be vulnerable to erosion.  \r\n \r\n2.3.15.  Wind  \r\nVisually inspect  the site for insecure equipment, roofing, cladding, glazing, or other \r\nevidence of wind damage. Use FEMA \"Guidelines for Wind Vulnerability Assessments \r\nof Existing Critical Facilities\", FEMA P -2062, \r\nhttps://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -07/guidelines -wind-vulnerability.pdf  as a \r\nresource to recognize common wind vulnerabilities, but compliance with this FEMA \r\ndocument is beyond the scope of this report.  \r\n \r\n2.3.16.  Lightning  \r\nAssess features of each  property that may be more prone to receive lightning strikes or \r\nmore susceptible to be damaged by them, for example antennae or trees rising more \r\nthan 20m above ground level, or solar panels or munition storage at any hei ght. NFPA \r\n780 Annex L provides information on lightning risk assessment, but compliance with this \r\nstandard is beyond the scope of t his report.  \r\n \r\n2.3.17.  Condensation  \r\nSearch for evidence of condensation damage that may be accelerated by a changing \r\nclimate, or by increased HVAC operation in response to a changing climate. Document \r\nefforts to control condensation and assess their effectiveness.  \r\n \r\n2.3.18.  Expansion -contraction  \r\nSearch for evidence of freeze -thaw damage, erosion, subsidence or sinkholes that may \r\nbe aggravated by changing weather conditions. Document measures in place to \r\nstabilize damage and assess their effectiveness. Look for copper domestic water piping \r\nor unprotected hydronic piping that could burst in a heating outage. Document bowed or \r\ncracked foundation walls or other evidence of expansive clay soils.  \r\n \r\n2.3.19.  Biologicals  \r\nRecord any presence of pests, mold,  fungus o r unintended plant growth in each  \r\nbuilding, and assess the potential for new or increased intrusion resulting from a \r\nchanging climate. Document measures in place to control pests such as mosquito \r\nscreens and note their condition. The threshold of materiality varies with the potential \r\nhealth consequences, so known disease carriers and allergen producers deserve more \r\nscrutiny.  \r\n \r\n2.3.20.  Summary  \r\nSummarize identified vulnerabilities. Highlight which ones may be of greatest concern, \r\nbased on their potential impa ct on building operations and the absence or \r\nineffectiveness of mitigation measure.  \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n19 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.21.  Electrical backup  \r\nDescribe electrical back -up systems or redundant feeds, if any. Confirm whether \r\nislanded operation is possible in an outage, and whether it is automatic  or manual. \r\nIdentify the upstream services that back -up generation relies on, for example \r\ntransportation for propane delivery. Record power capacity of on -site generators and \r\ninverters and compare to the building\'s operational needs. State whether the back -up \r\nsystem only serves essential circuits or the entire building. If batteries or fuel tanks are \r\npresent, evaluate the duration of back -up power they would support. If back -up \r\ngeneration includes wind or solar, define how back -up duration would vary with \r\nseasonality and weather conditions.  \r\n \r\n2.3.22.  Electrical readiness  \r\nReview maintenance and testing records of back -up electrical generators, transfer \r\nswitches, batteries and inverters and assess their readiness. Report frequency and \r\nresults of black start testing.  \r\n \r\n2.3.23.  Lightning  \r\nIf any lightning vulnerabilities have been identified, or if the building is taller than 20m, \r\nassess the condition and functionality of lightning protection systems, grounding \r\nsystems, equipotential bonding, gas discharge tubes, and permanently i nstalled surge \r\nprotection devices. Ignore plug -in power bars. Visually inspect for loose connection, \r\nfasteners, or indications of damage. Review maintenance records for compliance with \r\nNFPA 780  Annex D, \"Inspection and Maintenance of Lightning Protection systems\". \r\nRecommend any continuity tests, ground resistance tests, or tightening of clamps and \r\nsplicers that seem to have been neglected by regular maintenance. Document the \r\npresence of lightnin g protection for trees and conformance with NFPA 780 Annex F, \r\n\"Protection for Trees\".  \r\n \r\n2.3.24.  Water  \r\nAssess each  building\'s capacity to operate during interruptions, degradation, or \r\nrationing of water supplies. Record the p resence of low -flush toilets, graywater s ystems, \r\nrainwater collection, storage tanks, and equipment to boil and filter water.  \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.25.  Utility capacity  \r\nQuantify the margin by which electrical, natural gas, water, communications and other \r\nservice capacities exceed peak demand, and which could be made av ailable to \r\nexpanded or absorbed operations.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n20 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.26.  Blackout  \r\nAssess the building\'s capacity to operate in the complete absence of electricity, \r\nassuming electrical back -up systems are inoperable. Note accessibility features, sump \r\npumps and life safety systems that depend on electricity.  \r\n \r\n2.3.27.  Reparability  \r\nDiscuss any fea tures that may make the facility unusually difficult to repair. This may \r\ninclude difficult access for large equipment replacement, obsolete refrigerants, or \r\nhazardous building materials. Suggest spares stockpiles or material handling equipment \r\nthat could b e kept on hand to enable rapid recovery.  \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.28.  Contamination  \r\nAssess the potential for hazardous fluids on site to contaminate water during a flood, to \r\naccelerate a wide -area fire that consumes the building, or to contaminate land, air or \r\nwater in the event of building damage. Handheld consumables are generally not \r\nmaterial to this assessment, unless extraordinarily hazardous or present in bulk \r\nquantities. Potential spills of HVAC refrigerant, hydronic antifreeze, natural gas or \r\nsewage, or pre -existing soil contamination that could be mobilized by changing \r\ngroundwater conditions or unprecedented soil temperature conditions may be material \r\nto this assessment. Quantify potential contamination where possible. Note the height at \r\nwhich materials are stored. D ocument the presence and condition of spill guards, multi -\r\nlayer containment, excess flow valves, backflow preventers, and fireproofing.  \r\n \r\n2.3.29.  Debris  \r\nAssess the potential for the site to produce hazardous debris that could fall, roll over or \r\nbe carried away in a  flood or windstorm and aggravate structural damage elsewhere or \r\npose safety threats. Estimate the potential spread of asbestos and lead paint debris \r\nfrom building damage.  \r\n \r\n2.3.30.  Resilience upgrades  \r\nPropose sensible precautions to prepare for a more difficult c limate. This may include \r\nmeasures that reduce vulnerability or criticality of the building or improve its robustness, \r\nadaptability, resourcefulness, or rapid recovery potential. Provide a list of measures \r\nconsidered, but felt to be impractical, with brief reasons for rejection.  \r\n \r\n2.3.31.  Electrical backup  \r\nRecognizing that electricity is often the most fragile service essential to operations, \r\nrecommend backup options.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n21 \r\n \r\n \r\n2.3.32.  Hidden vulnerabilities  \r\nIf disassembly, testing, borescope examination, or other specialized inspec tion would \r\nbe advisable to fully assess vulnerabilities or the effectiveness of backup measures, \r\ndescribe the potential defects that such an inspection might expose. Recommend \r\nsuitable inspection procedures, standards and personnel qualifications that coul d \r\nprovide definitive confirmation.  \r\n \r\n2.3.33.  Cost estimates  \r\nResilience recommendations costing more than $5,000 should include estimates of \r\ncapital cost, operational costs, consequences of inaction, and frequency of threat to \r\nenable decision making regarding which  resilience measures should be implemented.  \r\nWhere possible, provide a financial analysis showing probability -weighted simple \r\npayback period for the resilience measures. If the value of a resilience measure \r\ndepends on a low probability disaster then financi al analysis is beyond the scope of this \r\nassessment. In these cases where financial analysis is not done, provide a qualitative \r\nevaluation of priority based on existing vulnerability and criticality.  \r\nIdentify potential incentive funds for resilience measure s, such as the Disaster \r\nMitigation and Adaptation Fund.  \r\nEstimate the impact of each measure on building operations and maintenance \r\nprocedures during the intervals between disasters.  \r\nIf climate change is likely to shorten the building\'s useful life in the absence of any \r\nresilience upgrades, predict the likely failure mode(s) and estimate remaining life if no \r\nresilience upgrades are implemented.  \r\n \r\n2.4. Summary of Deliverables  \r\nThe consultant will produce the following deliverables  for each location : \r\na) Net Zero study summary report  \r\nb) Solar PV design software report  \r\nc) Ground heat exchanger design software report  \r\nd) Energy modelling simulation files for each of the four scenarios  \r\ne) A financial analysis spreadsheet comparing the four scenarios   \r\nf) One-page business case for net zero emission scenario  \r\ng) Climate Change Resilience Assessment report  \r\nAll reports must be submitted in \"draft\" form to City of Toronto Project Manager and \r\ncirculated to the CREM staff for review. Even though the reports may have a \"draft\" \r\nstatus, they must pass the Consultant\'s quality assurance processes and be free \r\nfrom serious technical errors before being submitted to the City. Comments will be \r\nprovided on the level of satisfaction with the report contents and conclusions  before \r\nthe reports are to be finalized.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n22 \r\n \r\n \r\n3.0 Term of Contract  \r\n \r\n \r\n3.1 Upon Award of this RFQ , the Vendor and the City will have a Contract for the Deliverables  \r\nfor a period of one (1)  year,  , all in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications \r\ncontained in this RFQ and any applicable City policy.  \r\n \r\n4.0 Quotation Response Requirements  \r\n \r\n4.1 General Response Requirements  \r\n \r\n4.1.1  The following section lists the items that are to be included with your submission.

The City of \r\nToronto expects its Bidders to embrace and support the City of Toronto Social \r\nProcurement Program and its respective goals.  \r\n \r\nSocial Procurement  involves using purchasing power  and processes to advance positive \r\neconomic, workforce, and social development outcomes, in addition to the delivery of \r\nefficient goods, services,  and works. This includes  bringing greater diversity to the \r\ncontracting processes by addressing barriers for small and medium -sized enterprises, \r\nincluding those owned by members of equity -seeking groups and Social -purpose \r\nEnterprises. It comprises of a relatively wide range of act ivities, policies,  and programs \r\nemployed within geographies to create and sustain an inclusive workforce, create \r\npositive socio -economic impacts on low-income  populations, and support current and \r\nfuture business and industry. It is an approach that integra tes human service support, \r\nindustry -driven education,  and training, and career advancement strategies, facilitated \r\nby the collaboration between employers, training and education institutions, government, \r\nand communities.  \r\n \r\na. Supplier Diversity Requirements  \r\n \r\nAs part of the Social Procurement Program, t he City encourages Bidders to develop \r\nor provide an adopted supplier diversity policy that details the Bidder\'s means to \r\nimprove supplier diversity in the City\'s supply chain.  This is not a mandatory \r\nrequirement and will not be considered as part of the award.  A supplier diversity \r\npolicy may demonstrate its commitment to diversity by (but not limited to):  \r\n \r\n▪ Describing the Bidder\'s commitment to an active supplier diversity  program, \r\nincluding providing a company approved policy related to supplier diversity;  \r\n▪ Describing the Bidder\'s commitment to a pro -active employment diversity \r\nprogram, including providing th e company approved employee diversity policy; \r\nor, \r\n▪ Including proof of certification by a Supplier Certification Organization.  \r\n \r\n \r\nPART  5 – RFQ PARTICULARS  Doc3756696067  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n25 \r\n \r\n \r\nFor more information on the City of Toronto Social Procurement Program, visit: \r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2016/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile -91818.pdf  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAPPENDIX “ A” – SUPPLEMENTARY FORMS  \r\n \r\n \r\n1) Declaration of Compliance with Anti -Harassment/Discrimination Legislation & City Policy  \r\n \r\n2) Statutory Declaration (Occupational Health & Safety)  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nDeclaration of Compliance with Anti -Harassment/Discrimination  \r\nLegislation & City Policy  \r\n \r\nOrganizations/individuals in Ontario, including the City of Toronto, have obligations under the Ontario Human Rights \r\nCode, the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Employment Standards Act, the Accessibility for Ontarians with \r\nDisabilities Act, the Crim inal Code of Canada and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Background  \r\nThe successful bidder of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) will  undertake a Net Zero Emission \r\nFeasibility Study and Climate Change Resilience Assessment  at Cummer Lodge (205 Cummer \r\nAvenue)  \r\n \r\n2.1.1.  Zero Emission Study  \r\nToronto City Council has adopted the TransformTO  strategy on December 15, 2021 to reduce \r\ncommunity -wide greenho use gas (GHG) emissions in Toronto to net zero by 2040. Council wants \r\nthe City Corporation to lead the community by example,  and 2021.IE26.16 clause 1(f)  instructed \r\nthat \"as of 2023, any new equipment being installed in a City facility must contribute to net zero \r\nand all new buildings be desi gned and built to net zero.\" These actions build on the Climate \r\nEmergency  (2019.MM10.3) declared by Council on October 2, 2019.  \r\nIn support of these initiatives, Corporate  Real Estate Management presented a Net Zero Carbon \r\nPlan (2021.IE23.2 ) which was accepted by council for information on July 24, 2021. This plan \r\ndescribes how City buildi ngs will achieve net zero emissions status incrementally , synchronously \r\nwith the application of a climate lens and Financial Planning\'s asset management strategy. F uel \r\nswitching and efficiency retrofits are the primary method for emissions reductions.  \r\nIn order to integrate retrofits into the Capital Planning Proc ess, the City needs to develop budget \r\nand timeline estimates for each individual building to achieve zero emissions. The net zero \r\nstudies described by this scope will inform these estimates and supp ort decisions for strategic \r\ndivestment and renewal.  \r\n \r\n2.1.2.  Clima te Change Resilience Assessment  \r\nToronto’s Resilience Strategy  sets out a vision, goals, and actions to help Toronto survive, adapt \r\nand thrive in the face of any challen ge, particularly climate change and growing inequities. Both \r\nchronic stresses and acute shocks are considered.  \r\nRecoveryTO  provides a snapshot of the City’s recovery and rebuild decisions, reports, dat a, \r\ndashboards, and media announcement s. As a city we are experiencing one of the most \r\nchallenging periods in our recent history with significant economic, social and health implications \r\nand disproportionate impacts to Toronto’s Black, Indigenous and equity -deserving communities. \r\nWhile the City cont inues to respond to the immediate needs of our residents, communities and \r\nbusiness, we are also laying the foundation and taking action for the social and economic \r\nrecovery of our City. Climate Action & Resilience  is one of RecoveryTO\'s six themes.  \r\nCorporate Real E state Management helps support urban resili ence goals by offering the following \r\ncharacteristics:  \r\n• Robustness —the ability to keep operating in the face of disaster. It translates into \r\ndesigning structures or s ystems to be strong enough or devising substitute  or redundant \r\nsystems to maintain operation s. Robustness also entails investing in and maintaining \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n2 \r\n \r\nelements of critical infrastructure to withstand low -probability but high -consequence \r\nevents.  \r\n• Adaptability —the ability to absorb new lessons that can be dra wn from a catastrophe. It \r\ninvolves revising  plans, modifying procedures, and introducing new tools and technologies \r\nto improve robustness, resourcefulness and recovery capabilities before the next crisis.  \r\n• Resourcefulness —the ability to skillfully manage a disaster as it unfolds. It   includes \r\nident ifying options, prioritizing what should be done both to control damage and to mitigate \r\nit, and communicating decisions for implementation. Resourcefulness depends primarily \r\non people, not technology. Resourcefuln ess also includes the ability to cope if a key \r\nresource such as backup power becomes inoperable.  \r\n• Rapid Recovery —the capacity to get systems back to normal as quickly as possible after a \r\ndisaster. Carefully drafted contingency plans, competent emergency ope rations to get the \r\nappropriate manpower and  resources to the right places are crucial. This may mean \r\ngetting only critical systems up and running quickly while less critical systems can be \r\nslower to recover.  \r\n2.2. General Site Information  \r\nCummer Lodge is a Long -Term Care Home located at 205 Cummer Avenue  that was constructed \r\nin 1970 and currently houses approximately 390 residents. It has four stories and a basement and \r\nis approximately 291,000 square feet in gross floor area. The building operates 24/7 and contains \r\nthe following amenities:  \r\n• Industrial kit chen on main floor  \r\n• Three recreation rooms each containing a fridge, microwave , and stove  \r\n• Industrial laundry room and three family laundry rooms  \r\n• Multiple computers on each floor  \r\n• Hairdressing salon with  hair dryers, ceiling lifts, and manual lifts  \r\n2.3. Procedures  \r\nReview available documents and perform site visits to identify opportunities for emission \r\nreduction and resilience measures.  \r\n2.4. Utility billing data  \r\nReview three years of utility billing data for all energy sources; natural gas, propane, diesel, \r\nheating oil , electricity, district heating and cooling. Review one year of hourly interval electricity \r\nconsumption and one year of BAS data.  \r\n \r\n2.5. Document review  \r\nReview available documents. (Drawings, Building Condition Assessments, specifications, OEM \r\nmanuals, and servi ce records) The City will provide all available related documents and drawings \r\nto the Consultant for reference only. It shall be the Consultant\'s responsibility to verify through site \r\nvisits that existing systems conform to available documents and drawings , or to record deviations. \r\nKey drawings or other documents may be missing and  cannot be relied on to be accurate even \r\nwhen they are available. Revising the City\'s drawings or documents is outside the scope of the \r\ncontract.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n3 \r\n \r\n2.6. Site surveys  \r\nPerform site visits  to verify and complement drawings, documents and data. Interview building \r\noperators and occupants. Review operation and maintenance procedures. Collect equipment set \r\npoints, operating schedules, and photos of nameplates. Tour the land that the facility re sides on. \r\nIdentify neighbouring facilities.  \r\nEstimate insulation level (R -value) of existing envelope components. Where wall and ceiling \r\ncavities cannot be adequately inspected through existing openings, the Consultant shall remove \r\nelectrical cover plates, baseboards, and/or ceiling panels to identify insulation. If cavities cannot \r\nbe adequately inspected by removing these covers, the Consultant shall drill a ¼\" hole and \r\ninspect with a borescope. If asbestos is present or suspected, the City will provide the  consultant \r\nwith the Safe Working Procedure for the work. More invasive inspections are beyond the scope of \r\nthis contract, but the Consultant should flag remaining uncertainties and may recommend further \r\ninspections in the report. Do not disturb piping ins ulation. Covering must be reinstalled and holes \r\nmust be patched.  \r\n \r\n2.7. Fair Wage Policy  \r\nThe provisions of the Fair Wage Policy apply equally to contractors and all sub -contractors \r\nengaged in work for the City of Toronto.   Specifically, drilling and repair work that may be required \r\nfor insulation investigation, will also be subject to the City\'s Fair Wage policy. The Fair Wage \r\nOffice administers the Fair Wage  Policy that prohibits the City from doing business with \r\ncontractors and suppliers who discriminate a gains t their workers.  \r\nThe Fair Wage Office investigates complaints and takes enforcement action when it is \r\ndetermined that a contractor has failed to pay its workers the prescribed fair wage or has not \r\nabided by the labour trade contractual obligations in  the construction industry (collective \r\nagreements).  \r\nThe Fair Wage Policy and Fair Wage Schedules can be found at the following website:  \r\nhttp://www.toronto.ca/fairwage   \r\nIt is the responsibility of the successful bi dder to familiarize themselves with the City of Toronto\'s \r\nFair Wage Policy and City of Toronto\'s labour trade contractual obligations in the construction \r\nindustry (collective agreements) that apply to this work. The successful bidder must comm it to \r\nabide b y the City of Toronto\'s Fair Wage Policy and la bour trade contractual obligations in the \r\nconstruction industry.  \r\nIt is the responsibility of the successful bidder to ensure that work performed in connection with \r\nthe insulation investigation wi ll be perform ed by a worker belonging to the appropriate labour \r\ntrade union and/or the appropriate wage rate from the appropriate wage schedule is applied.  \r\nIn the event that other Fair Wage Schedules may overlap the work covered by this Contract or if \r\nyou have any que stions with respect to the Fair Wage Policy or the Fair Wage Schedules please \r\ncontact the Fair Wage Office by:  \r\n• Tel: (416) 392 -7300  \r\n• Fax:(416) 392 -0801  \r\n• E-Mail: fairwage@toronto.ca  \r\n \r\n2.8. Asbestos  \r\nAsbestos may becom e airborne if disturbed, and is hazardous if inhaled. Asbestos was \r\nextensively used in Canadian building materials until 1980, before being phased out to a nearly \r\ncomplete ban in 2018. Of particular importance to this scope, it w as commonly found in drywal l \r\npanels, plaster, and insulatio n. The City will provide the Consultant with the most recent \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n4 \r\n \r\nDesignated Substances Survey for this site and guidance regarding safe work procedures in the \r\npresence of suspected or confirmed asbesto s. The Consultant is respon sible for providing \r\nappropriate safety training, safety equipment, and safe working procedures to their staff, in \r\naccordance with the City\'s asbestos management  policy and designated substances policy.   \r\n \r\n2.9. Project Meetings and Scheduling  \r\nThe Consultant is to provide a detailed breakdown work plan of the project scope of work and \r\nschedule within two (2) weeks after award for review and approval by the C ity.  The schedule is to \r\nbe updated monthly, and reviewed with the C ity\'s Project Manager.  Changes to the project \r\nschedule require a written explanation and must be approved, in writing, by the City.  \r\nThe Consultant shall be res ponsible for the preparation  of agendas and minutes for the meetings \r\nand shall ensure that these are prepared and submitted to attendees within one (1) week prior to \r\nand after meetings, respectively.  \r\n \r\n3.0 Net Zero Emission Study  \r\n3.1.1  Objective  \r\nThe Zero Emission study e xplores different combin ations of emission reduction measures \r\n(ERMs), energy conservation measure s (ECM), and fuel switching options that could achieve a \r\nnet-zero emission building while minimizing costs. A net -zero emissions build ing is one that is \r\nhighly  energy -efficient and pr oduces onsite, or procures, carbon -free and/or renewable energy in \r\nan amount sufficient to offset the annual carbon emissions associated with its operations or \r\nsimply eliminates carbon emissions altogether. Off -site carbon offsets a re permitted as the last  \r\nresort, but the consultant must provide the rationale for this decision and demonstrate that all \r\nother options have been investigated and eliminated . The Zero Emission study is similar in nature \r\nto an ASHRAE 211 Level 2 energy audi t. The Zero Emissions st udy requires air tightness testing, \r\ninsulation assessment and building energy modelling; these are also routine elements of a level 2 \r\nenergy audit according to ASHRAE  211 sections 5.4.5.2(n), 6.2.1.2 an d 5.4.5.3(b) respectively. \r\nThe Zero Emission study dif fers from traditional energy audits in its emphasis on deep emission \r\nreductions as opposed to marginal cost reductions. Deep emission reduction measures generally \r\nhave strong interactive effects which must be taken into account, even though this is normall y left \r\nto a level 3 audit. The Study will bundle measures together into four scenarios for analysis of \r\nemissions and life cycle costs.  \r\n \r\n3.1.2  Deliverables  \r\nThe Study will produce the following deliverables:  \r\n1. A summary report, including the following sections at a minimum:  \r\na. Executive Summary  \r\nb. Introduction  \r\nc. Building Description  \r\nd. Assessment of challenges and opportunities  \r\ne. Assessment of challenges and opportunities including, but not limited to:  \r\ni. Analysis of supply tempe rature  \r\nii. Analysis of ground heat exchanger potential  \r\niii. Electrical service capacity and upgrade limitations  \r\niv. Other emission reduction and energy conservation measures  \r\nf. Summary of Four Scenarios  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n5 \r\n \r\ng. Net Zero Transition Plan  \r\nh. Summary of financial performance of th e four scenarios  \r\ni. Recommendation  \r\n2. Solar PV design soft ware report  \r\n3. Ground heat exchanger design software report  \r\n4. Energy modelling simulation files for each of the four scenarios  \r\n5. A financial analysis spreadsheet comparing the four scenarios  \r\n6. One-page busin ess case for net zero emission scenario  \r\nThe Study dra ft report is submitted to City of Toronto Project Manager and circulated to the \r\nCREM staff for review. Even though the report may have a \"draft\" status, it must pass the \r\nConsultant\'s quality assurance p rocesses and be free from serious technical errors bef ore being \r\nsubmitted to the City. Comments will be provided on the level of satisfaction with the report \r\ncontents and conclusions before the report is to be finalized.  \r\nThe energy modelling files will be reviewed by an energy modelling expert for reasonablen ess \r\nand calibration accuracy.  \r\n \r\n3.1.3  Measure Assessment  \r\nIdentify an initial list of emission reduction measures (ERMs) that have the best potential to \r\ncontribute towards a net zero emission building. ERMs tend to have strong interactive effect, so \r\nthere is no ex pectation to evaluate the costs and emission savings of individual measures. Costs \r\nand savings will be modelled for groupings of measures called scenarios.  \r\nThe specific ERMs discussed in the sections  below must be assessed, unless the City approves \r\ntheir e xclusion. The Geoexchange, District Heating and Biofuels assessments are not needed if \r\nALL of the following are true:  \r\n• 100% of the TEDI is already supplied by some combination of these heat sources  \r\n• All biofuels in use already meet the eligibility criteria o f the CaGBC Zero Carbon Building \r\nDesign Standard v3 for zero emission biofuels  \r\n• All district heating meets ONE of the following requirements:  \r\no the CaGBC NZB Design v3 definition of \"Green Heat\", OR  \r\no the owner has published a transition plan to remove combusti on \r\n• Building comfort complies with ASHRAE 55  \r\n3.1.4  Supply temperature  \r\nIdentify make and model of existing air handling units, fan coils, radiators, and circulation pumps. \r\nCollect specifications, or, if u navailable or modified, estimate capacities and supply tempe rature \r\nrequirements.  The Consultant shall review radiators, fan coils, air handling units, heat \r\nexchangers, pumps, pipe sizes and duct sizes to determine the minimum supply temperature that \r\nwould allow the existing heat distribution system to meet the desi gn heating load. Identify  limiting \r\ncomponents. Estimate costs and space requirements that may be needed for upgrades that \r\nwould lower the minimum supply temperature.  The Consultant must explore op tions to reduce the \r\nsupply temperature well below the maximu m supply temperature of r elevant heat pumps, since \r\nheat pumps are heavily derated at high supply temperatures. Review floor layout and ceiling \r\nheight to assess the impacts and costs of installing a hydronic radiant heated floors. Determine \r\nwhether or not a  structural analysis woul d be warranted, but structural analysis is not part of this \r\nscope of work. Determine if heritage registration of the building may constrain radiant floor, \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n6 \r\n \r\nradiator or fan coil design.  If the system uses steam distribution, the Stud y must estimate the \r\ncosts  of converting to warm water distribution.  \r\n \r\n3.1.5  Waste heat recovery  \r\nIdentify opportunities for waste heat recovery. Identify opportunities that may exist from or to \r\nnearby facilities.  \r\n \r\n3.1.6  Geoexchange  \r\nQuantify land area that could be used for geoexchange trenches, wells, or pond loops. Describe \r\nthe current surface covering (parking lot, cultivated flowers, etc.) over likely sites. Evaluate \r\naccessibility for drilling or tr enching equipment, which may include the utilization of bringing \r\nminia ture drilling equipment into the building basement or rear lots.  \r\nThe Consultant shall make a reasonable effort to flag possible subsurface issues with drilling at \r\nthe site.  \r\nAfter review  of site layout, site access, and subsurface issues, evaluate the pote ntial capacity of a \r\nplausible ground heat exchanger design. Consider opportunities for vertical, horizontal or \r\nsubmerged heat exchangers. Ground heat exchanger sizing shall be done with Ground Loop \r\nDesign (G LD), Earth Energy Designer (EED) , Ground Loop Heat Exchanger Design GLHEPRO  \r\nor Looplink Pro . Provide the soft ware report as an attachment to the study. If open land area is \r\ninadequate, consider directional drilling or drilling from the basement. If the potential capacity of a \r\nvertical ground he at exchanger is insufficient to meet building loads, identify opportun ities to \r\nimprove system balance.  \r\nIf a geoexchange system is selected for inclusion in one or more of the scenarios, provide a \r\nlayout for the proposed borefield, trenching and connection  points, including depth indications \r\nand pipe diameters. Identify envi ronmental or navigation impacts that may constrain submerged \r\nheat exchanger design.  \r\n \r\n3.1.7  District heating system  \r\nIf a district energy system exists in the area, evaluate the energy, cost, and GHG impacts of \r\nconnecting to it. If a district energy system is pla nned in the area, and the Payback scenario does \r\nnot achieve zero GHGI, that scenario must comply with the City  of Toronto\'s Design Guidel ine for \r\nDistrict Energy -Ready Buildings  to ensure that future connection is not precluded by this retrofit. \r\nThe other scenarios may include a district heating connection, but need not be district energy -\r\nready.  \r\nIf any scenario includes district heating or cooling, recommend specific additional e quipment or \r\nmodifications needed to enable monitoring of steam, chilled water, and hot water flows from t he \r\nutility. Identify any data format obsolescence or interface obsolescence risks with existing \r\nequipment. Incl ude new or replacement equipment costs i n the capital costs of each scenario \r\nwhere district heating or cooling is present, including the Baseline scenario.  \r\n \r\n3.1.8  Biofuels  \r\nWhere biofuels sources are available on site in substantial quantities, consider opportuni ties for \r\ndirect use of landfill gas, sew er gas, sewage heat recovery, or waste wood.  \r\n \r\n3.1.9  Demand heating  \r\nAssess opportunities for localized on -demand heating in zones with sparse or intermittent \r\noccupancy.  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n7 \r\n \r\n \r\n3.1.10  Electrical peak demand  \r\nDetermine the capacity of exi sting electrical service. Identify limit ing components. Estimate costs \r\nand space requirements that may be needed to upgrade electrical service to levels needed for \r\nbuilding electrification while continuing to support existing vehicle chargers. Separately e stimate \r\nthe incremental cost to support J1772 (level 2) chargers for 25% of regular parking spaces and \r\n100% of service vehicle bays, but do not include in any of the four scenarios.  \r\nIdentify opportunities to shape demand to keep it within existing peak cap acity limits, or to provide \r\ndemand respo nse capacity to the grid.  This may include shaping the setpoint schedule, sizing \r\nbuffer tanks, scheduling DHW production, or controlling vehicle chargers.  \r\nThe Consultant must at least assess the potential to use an  oversized buffer tank or other thermal \r\nstorage to shift a significant portion of electrical loads away from peak time -of-use hours. Either \r\nwater tank or phase -change materials may be considered, depending on space availability.  \r\n \r\n3.1.11  Air infiltration  \r\nQuantify  envelope air leakage through testing an d locate dominant leaks. See Toronto Green \r\nStandard non -mandatory Guidance Document on Air Tightness Testing Protocol &  Process . \r\nTesting methods may be adapte d to the particular constraints and logistics of each building. \r\nUsing the building\'s existing ventilation system for the test per CGSB - CAN/CGSB -149.10 -M86 is \r\npermissible if a pressure difference of at least 50 Pa c an be achieved. Tracer gas tests per AST M \r\nE 1186 may be permissible subject to City approval of the tracer gas quantity, global warming \r\npotential, and cost savings. Guarded airt ightness testing may be performed where it is easier \r\nthan full building testing , and areas with low human occupancy may be excluded.  \r\nPropose approaches for sealing identified air leaks, or for a general upgrade in air tightness.  An \r\nair blower test is outside the scope of this study.  \r\n \r\n3.1.12  Solar panels  \r\nAssess the feasibility of solar syste m installation (both photov oltaic (PV) and thermal) on the roof \r\nand walls of the building, windows (Building -Integrated solar PV - BIPV) and the grounds, for \r\nexample solar carport over the parking lot/garage. For analysis please use a minimum of 400W \r\nsolar  PV panels placed at 10 deg ree angle on rooftop and carport systems. Determine whether or \r\nnot a structural analysis is warranted, but structural analysis is not part of this scope of work. \r\nDetermine if electrical service capacity or heritage registration o f the building may constrai n the \r\nsolar design.  \r\nConduct a long -term shading study incorporating existing and permitted building heights and \r\nother obstructions to the southeast, south and southwest of the site.  \r\nProvide an estimate of the maximum PV system si ze, and system production u sing accepted \r\nindustry solar PV design software. ( PVSyst  and Helioscope  are preferred) Provide the software \r\nreport as an attachment to the study.  \r\nProvide preliminary layout  of the potential system taking into account the set -back from the \r\nproperty edge and shading (for ground systems) and roof edges, mechanical equipment, and \r\ngreen roof requirements (for roof based systems).  \r\n \r\n3.1.13  Conventional measures  \r\nEvaluate the potential of the following energy conservation measures to reduce emissions and \r\nimprove payback, or provide reasons for not recommending them:  \r\n• Interior and exterior lighting retrofits  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n8 \r\n \r\n• demand control ventilation  \r\n• water conservation strategies  \r\n• roof insulation upgrade to EnerPHit or CaGBC prescriptive standards  \r\n• window upgrades to triple pane  \r\n• resistive electrical heating  \r\n• air source heat pumps  \r\n• decommissioning of combined heat and power systems  \r\n3.1.14  Scenarios  \r\nAssemble ERMs and ECMs into four scenarios and  build an energy model for each:  \r\n1. Baseline Scenario: purchase of emission offsets instead of modifying the building  \r\n2. Simple Scenario: deep emission reductions at low capital costs  \r\n3. Zero Emission Scenario: reducing emissions as much as reasonably achievable  \r\n4. Paybac k Scenario: using energy savings to pay for emission reductions  \r\nTypical bundles of measures are provided in the definition of each scenario for illustration only. \r\nThe Consultant must apply sound engineering judgement to select a reasonable bundle of \r\nmeasures that fit the definition of each scenario. Develop energy models for all four scenarios. \r\nProvide a Class D costing analysis and life cycle cost analysis of each scenario. Provide advice \r\non design and pricing allowances for items not yet known, as wel l as risk allowances.  \r\nLimited combustion is permitted in each scenario as follows:  \r\n Baseline  Simple  Zero Payback  \r\nNew or replacement natural gas equipment      \r\nLife extension of existing natural gas \r\nequipment  ✓   ✓ \r\nOn-site electricity generation fro m fossil fuels  ✓   ✓ \r\nBiofuels with LULUCF emissions  ✓ ✓  ✓ \r\nBiofuels with zero emissions  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ \r\nEmergency fossil fuel generators for power \r\noutages  ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ \r\n ✓= Allowed    = Forbidden  \r\nNone of the scenarios may include any new or replacement natural gas, propane or diesel \r\nequipment. Some scenarios may include life extension measures such as boiler tube \r\nreplacement or overhaul of combined heat and power systems, but not boiler replacement . If \r\nbiofuels are used in any scenario, emiss ions from land use, land use change, and forestry \r\n(LULUCF) must be included in GHG calculations, unless they meet the eligibility criteria of the \r\nCaGBC Zero Carbon Building Design Standard v3 for zero emission biofuels.  \r\n \r\n3.1.15  Baseline Scenario  \r\nThe Baseline Scenario is composed of the minimal state -of-good -repair (SOGR) measures \r\nneeded to keep the building operational. Major SOGR measures should be assumed to meet the \r\nminimum prescriptive requirements of the Ontario Building Code supplementary standa rd SB -10. \r\nThis may incidentally p roduce energy or emission improvements relative to historical \r\nperformance. For example, if the roof is leaking and needs replacement, the new roof should be \r\nassumed to come with improved insulation to meet SB -10. However, t he baseline scenario \r\nexcludes any  measure intended primarily to conserve energy or reduce emissions, such as extra \r\nroof insulation to meet EnerPHit or CaGBC standards.  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n9 \r\n \r\n \r\n3.1.16  Simple Scenario  \r\nThe Simple Scenario is composed of measures needed to eliminate on -site combustion of fossil \r\nfuels at mi nimum capital costs. For most facilities, this would mean replacing all on -site natural \r\ngas equipment with resistive electric equivalents, such as electric boilers, electric baseboards, \r\nelectric water heaters, electric drye rs, electric stoves, etc., combin ed with enough electricity \r\nconservation measures to mitigate the need for service capacity upgrades. Alternatively, this may \r\nmean connecting to an existing district heating system, or switching to biofuels, if this can be \r\ndone at a lower capital cost than a resistive electrical retrofit.  \r\nThe Simple Scenario should include any measures that lower overall capital costs without \r\nincreasing emissions. The Simple Scenario should also include any electricity conservation \r\nmeasure wi th a simple payback period of one  year or less, including the cost of clean electricity \r\noffsets in the calculation.  \r\n3.1.17  Zero Emission Scenario  \r\nThe Zero Emission Scenario is composed of all measures needed to bring the building in \r\ncompliance with one of the fo llowing two standards:  \r\n• Passive House Institute EnerPHit , Classic rating or better; or  \r\n• CaGBC Zero Carb on Building Design Standard  v3 \r\nNote: Do not confuse the CaGBC Performance standard, which applies to all scenarios, with the \r\nDesign standard, which only applies to the Zero Emission scenario.  \r\nEach standard offers multiple compliance pathways or options. T he Consultant is expected to \r\nselect the standard and pathway that would, in their judgement, require the least effort for \r\nmodelli ng and costing, even if that may not result in the lowest constr uction cost. The study must \r\nstate which standard was chosen, an d which compliance pathway or options were chosen.  \r\nThe study must consider ASHP, GSHP, and resistive electric heating options in  sufficient detail to \r\ndetermine which option is likely to have the shortest Simple Payback Period, and incorporate that \r\noption into the Zero Emission Scenario. That comparison must consider differences in \r\nmaintenance costs and clean electricity offset cost s. \r\nBiofuels such as renewable natural gas or biomass must meet the eligibility criteria of the CaGBC \r\nZero Carbon Building Desig n Standard v3 for zero emission biofuels. Existing biofuel systems \r\nthat do not comply must be replaced. Existing district energy systems must be replaced, unless \r\nthey meet the CaGBC\'s definition of Green Heat or the owner has published a transition plan to  \r\neliminate combustion.  \r\n \r\n3.1.18  Payback Scenario  \r\nThe Payback Scenario is composed of a blend of ECMs and ERMs that minimizes GHGI while \r\nproviding a simple payback period of 30 years or less relative to the Baseline Scenario. If a GHGI \r\nof zero may be achieved with a simple payback period of 30 years or less, select a grouping of \r\nmeasures to minimize payback period while keeping a GHGI of zer o. \r\nFor most facilities, the Payback scenario is typically expected to include the following features:  \r\n• all electricity conservat ion measures that have a simple payback period shorter than 30 \r\nyears  \r\n• as much solar photovoltaic generation as the site will allow  \r\n• a selection of the envelope upgrades considered in the Zero Emissions scenario  \r\n• a combination of ASHP, GSHP, and district heati ng to supply most of TEDI  \r\n• supplementary heating for the coldest days of winter  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n10 \r\n \r\nThe Consultant must apply sound engineering judgment to select a reasonable bundle of \r\nmeasures that fits the scenario definition.  \r\nIdentify any data format obsolescence or interf ace obsolescence risks with existing equipment.  \r\n \r\n3.1.19  Energy Modelling  \r\nDevelop a building energy model for each sce nario. Use the energy model to calculate TEDI, \r\nannual electricity consumption, annual natural gas consumption, and annual electricity generation \r\nof each scenario. Any difference of more than ±10% between the Baseline model annual utility \r\nconsumption and th e historical annual consumption from billing data must be explained. Calculate \r\nEnergy Use Intensity (EUI) and Greenhouse Gas Intensity (GHGI). Fo r most buildings, EUI and \r\nGHGI calculations may be calculated from utility consumption in the Excel financial a nalysis \r\ntemplate provided by the City.  \r\nThe electronic simulation files must be provided as attachments to the study. Report values in the \r\nfollowi ng units:  \r\n• TEDI and EUI in units of kWh/m²/y  \r\n• GHGI in units of kgCO ₂e/m²/y  \r\n• Annual electricity consumption and gen eration in units of kWh or MWh  \r\n• Annual natural gas consumption in units of m³  \r\n• Annual emissions in units of tCO ₂e/m²/y, where t is a metric ton (1, 000 kg)  \r\nThe energy model may be built in RETScreen Expert  software using the Feasibility analysis type, \r\nor detailed calculations may be provided in wel l documented Excel spreadsheets. Regression \r\nmodels built in the R ETScreen Performance analysis type are not ade quate. The Consultant may \r\npropose alternative software instead of RETScreen, subject to t he City\'s approval. Calibrate the \r\nmodel against historic al billing data for all energy sources. The model should be able to \r\nreproduce at least three years of annual co nsumption to within ±10%. Provide a graph showing \r\nmonthly modelled and actual historical consumption over a typical year for comparison. \r\nPredicti ons of future consumption only need to be made on an annual basis, not monthly.  \r\nOn-site generation or cogeneration from fuels need not be modelled in RETScreen. Outdoor \r\nheating or snow melting need not be modelled in RETScreen. Supplement the RETScreen \r\nbuilding model with separate engineering calculations for the scenarios where these features are \r\npresent.  \r\n \r\n3.1.20  Zero Carbon Transition Plan  \r\nPropose a reasonable cost -effective sequence and timing of renovations to eliminate on -site \r\ncarbon emissions by 2040, and to  eventually remove any remaining biofuel combustion and \r\ndistrict heating off -site emissions beyond 204 0. The plan should be informed by the analysis \r\nresults of the four scenarios, but need not correspond precisely to any of them. Renovations \r\nshould general ly be timed to coincide with the end of service life of existing equipment, but \r\nconsideration must be given to transient conditions between retrofits.  \r\nSet out a realistic design -build approach and a distribution of capital investments over time. \r\nIdentify periods of time when operations must be reduced or relocated due to construction. \r\nDescribe natural int ervention points, such as the anticipated end of life of mechanical equipment \r\nor necessary SOGR renovations. A critical question that the Zero Carbon Tran sition Plan must \r\nexamine is whether to pursue electrification first or efficiency first, and what to d o in the interim. \r\nConsider the limits imposed by electrical service capacity and regulated phase -out timeline of \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n11 \r\n \r\nrefrigerants. Consider data collection op portunities that could help control future costs. Explain \r\nthe reasoning behind the choices made.  \r\nThe p roposed 2040 state of the building must not have any on -site combustion of fossil fuels, \r\nexcept for intermittent emissions from back -up systems that are o nly used in power outages, \r\nemergencies and occasional testing. If the proposed 2040 state of the build ing includes zero \r\nemission biofuels, describe the reasons why. Include in the transition plan the cost and timeline to \r\nremove biofuel combustion beyond 20 40.  \r\nDescribe how heating loads will be reduced. Describe the mechanical HVAC strategy and how \r\ncompone nts of the system will be adapted to accommodate non -combustion -based technologies. \r\nDescribe measures to facilitate the conversion to non -combustion -based  technologies, such as \r\ndesigning the HVAC system to use low -temperature distribution or allocating spa ce for renewable \r\nor electrical -sourced heating technologies. (e.g., heat pumps)  \r\n \r\n3.1.21  Financial Analysis  \r\nProvide a Class D costing analysis of each scenario, c omprised of an elemental summary and \r\nbased on rough costs per square metre. Break out the capital costs in the following categories:  \r\n1. HVAC upgrades  \r\n2. Renewable energy generation  \r\n3. Envelope enhancement upgrades  \r\n4. Commissioning, including post -retrofit air tightnes s testing if envelope is upgraded  \r\nProvide advice on design and pricing allowances for item s not yet known, as well as risk \r\nallowances. Identify applicable incentives from the provincial or federal governments or from \r\nutilities or private sources. Flag cond itions and deadlines that must be met in order for the \r\nmeasure to be eligible. Estimate in centive amount and include in the financial analysis as part of \r\nthe study.  \r\nProvide life cycle cost analyses of the four retrofit scenarios in a Microsoft Excel spread sheet \r\nattached to the report. The spreadsheet must show and label the capital costs, incen tives, annual \r\nenergy savings and annual greenhouse gas reductions of each scenario, and use these as inputs \r\nto the financial analysis.  \r\nIf the facility could qualify as a Class A electricity customer and the scenario includes measures \r\nto curtail demand to participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative, annual electricity costs \r\nmay be calculated with energy modelling software instead of Excel formulas. The energy  \r\nmodelling files must be provided to the City.  \r\nAn Excel workbook template is available fro m the City, which may provide a starting point. \r\nHowever, the Consultant is responsible for verifying whether the template calculations are \r\napplicable to the scenarios  being studied, and for modifying the workbook as required. \r\nInformation about situations r equiring customization are provided in the template.  \r\nThe financial analysis of all four scenarios will model the purchase of offset credits equal to any \r\nresidual emi ssions so as to comply with the CaGBC Zero Carbon Building Performance \r\nStandard . Do not confuse the Performance standard, which applies to all scenarios, with the \r\nDesign standard, which only applies to the Zero Emission scenario.  \r\nThe City will provide utility rate forecasts, discount rates, time horizon and cost schedule of high \r\nquality carbon offsets. Obtain emissi on intensity factors for Ontario from Environment Canada\'s \r\nmost rec ent National Inventory Report. Report these values and all other emission factors in the \r\nspreadsheet and cite the source. All scenarios must use the utility rates forecast by the City, \r\nincluding biofuels, and must assume the purchase of high quality carbon offsets equa l to net \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n12 \r\n \r\nbuilding emissions, including emissions from off -site generation of electricity, steam and hot \r\nwater. (i.e. ISO 14064 scope 2)  \r\nEncode Excel formulas to calculate, for each scenario, the simple payback period, (SPP) the 20 -\r\nyear net present value (N PV) in accordance with ASTM E 917 , and the 20 -year internal rate of \r\nreturn (IRR) in accordance with ASTM E 1057 . Calculate cumulative scope 2 GHG  emissions \r\nfrom present day to 2040 for all four scenarios, using methods in compliance with ISO 14064 Part \r\n2. \r\n \r\n3.1.22  Business  Case  \r\nDevelop a one -page stand -alone business case for Net Zero Emissions scenar io, structured for \r\nrapid reading and formatted to draw attention. Include non -monetary benefits such as improved \r\ncontrol  of airborne infections and thermal comfort. Use the sam e assumptions and financial \r\nmetrics as in the financial analysis above.  \r\n \r\n3.1.23  Recomme ndation  \r\nBased on the completed analysis, state a preferred scenario. The City\'s preferred scenario is the \r\nNet Zero Emission scenario by default, but the Consultant may recommen d a different scenario if \r\nunusual conditions make this scenario unreasonable. Provide recommendations and next steps \r\nto facilitate decarbonization.  \r\n  \r\n3.2 Climate Change Resilience Assessment  \r\n3.2.1  Objective  \r\nThe Climate Change Resiliency Assessment evaluates an indiv idual building\'s exposure and \r\nvulnerability to climate change, t ake an inventory of its resiliency features, and identify \r\nopport unities for improvement. City services at this location will rely on building resilience, but \r\noperational resilience of those se rvices is beyond the scope of this assessment.  \r\nThe CCRA is not an emergency plan. Emergency plans and equipment are a basic requirement \r\nfor all buildings, but the CCRA is intended look further to the building\'s capacity to support \r\ncontinuity of all City se rvices to the public, in spite of increasingly frequent and prolonged climate \r\ndisruptions. This includes, for example, cultural and recreational services.  \r\nComplete self -sufficiency and indestructability are unrealistic objectives for resilience. Service \r\ncontinuity can be maintained in spite of individu al asset losses so long as sufficient redundancy \r\nand capacity exists city -wide. This assessment is intended to evaluate the site\'s potential \r\ncontributions and demands towards city -wide resilience in the face o f climate disruptions. \r\nConsideration includes i rreplaceable cultural, historical or environmentally significant aspects of a \r\nbuilding or its contents.  \r\n \r\n3.2.2  Deliverables  \r\nThe Assessment will produce a report including the following sections at minimum  as applica ble \r\nto the site : \r\n1. Executive Summary  \r\n2. Introduction  \r\n3. General Description  \r\n4. Exposure  \r\n5. Vulnerability  \r\n6. Robustness  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n13 \r\n \r\n7. Adaptability  \r\n8. Resourcefulness  \r\n9. Rapid Recovery  \r\n10. Criticality  \r\n11. Resilience Upgrades Less Than $5,000  \r\n12. Capital Upgrades for Resilience  \r\nAll recommended measures shal l be tabulated with schedules and c ost. \r\nThe Study draft report is submitted to City of Toronto Project Manager and circulated to the \r\nCREM staff for review. Even though the report may have a \"draft\" status, it must pass the \r\nConsultant\'s quality assurance pr ocesses and be free from serious te chnical errors before being \r\nsubmitted to the City. Comments will be provided on the level of satisfaction with the report \r\ncontents and conclusions before the report is to be finalized.  \r\n \r\n3.2.3  Exposure  \r\nAssess the nature and degr ee to which the facility is exposed  to climate disruptions by virtue of its \r\ngeographical location, size and orientation. Extreme weather events are usually best described \r\nby intensity -duration -frequency curves rather than singular probabilities for arbitra ry thresholds.  \r\n \r\n3.2.4  Climate projections  \r\nCite the climate projection data selected to inform this resilience assessment. This may include \r\nbut need not cover all or be limited to the following resources:  \r\n• Ontario Climate Data Portal: https://lamps.math.yorku.ca/OntarioClimate/  \r\n• Ontario Climate Change Data Portal http://ontarioccdp.ca/  \r\n• Canadian Centre for Climate Services https://www.canada.ca/en/environment -climate -\r\nchange/services/climate -change/canadian -centre -climate -services.html  \r\n• Climate Data for a Resilient Canada: https:/climatedata.ca/   \r\n• The Climate Atlas of Canada: https://climateatlas.ca/   \r\n• Ontario Ministry of Transportation  IDF Curve Lookup: \r\nhttp://www.mto.gov.on.ca/IDF_Curves/terms.shtml  \r\nhttp://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~dprincz/mto_site/terms.sh tml \r\nMost climate change parameters can be assumed to be the same across the entir e City. This \r\nassessment may simply cite the sources where these parameters are documented instead of \r\nduplicating them in this assessment.  \r\n \r\n3.2.5  Overland flooding  \r\nAssess the futu re overland flooding risk for this property. Report the distance and elevation of th e \r\nsite above the nearest body of water. Provide topographic, permeability, and floodplain maps of  \r\nthe surrounding neighbourhood. The Consultant may use the following resources or equivalent \r\nalternatives:  \r\n• Land Information Ontario https://www.ontario.ca/page/land -information -ontario   \r\n• ArcGIS Online Land Permeability in Toronto \r\nhttps://www.arcgis.com/home/ item.html?id=2fb8d13f06f841c3b0aa505e2f98d646   \r\n• Toronto and Region Conservation Authority Flood P lain Map \r\nhttps://trca.ca/conservation/flood -risk-management/flood -plain-map-viewer/  \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n14 \r\n \r\nInvestigate if property is located within an area that has been or come near to b eing flooded due \r\nto ice jams. Gauge the possibility, based on surrounding slopes, that overland inflows could \r\nexceed outflows during extreme rainfall events. L ocate nearby storm drains. Make reasonable \r\nefforts to establish historical high water levels in the area.  Flood modeling is outside the scope of \r\nthis study.  \r\n \r\n3.2.6  Ground stability  \r\nAssess future ground stability risks for this property, given the potential for e xtreme rainfall and \r\nother climate disruptions. If the property is near an eroding shore or cliff such as the Scarborough \r\nBluffs, estimate how long the building may remain safe. Suggests thresholds that should trigger \r\nre-evaluation.  \r\n \r\n3.2.7  Wind exposure  \r\nEvaluate  the wind exposure factor in accordance with the current version of the National Building \r\nCode of Canada and Ontario Building Code. Use current versions of the codes, not the version in \r\neffect at time of construction.  \r\n \r\n3.2.8  Pests  \r\nAssess local prevalence of pest s. Agricultural pests are beyond the scope of this assessment.  \r\n \r\n3.2.9  Vulnerability  \r\nAssess pre-existing weaknesses that risk collapse under the pressures of climate change. \r\nVulnerabilities are generally not caused by climate change. They are typically a source o f risk or \r\nnuisance even before being aggravated by climate change.  \r\n \r\n3.2.10  Flood  \r\nIdentify an y equipment and structures that are located below grade, or within possible flood levels \r\nprojected by the \"Exposure\" section. Include both primary and back -up systems in t his \r\nassessment. Include sump pumps. Assess the effectiveness of waterproofing feature s in place.  \r\nCheck for flood sensors in elevator pits.  \r\n \r\n3.2.11  Flotation  \r\nDetermine if the site has any underground tanks or vaults. If present, determine the tank diameter \r\nand th e depth from finished grade to the top of the tank. If the depth is less than 60% of the \r\ndiameter, or if it could reasonably approach this limit due to erosion or subsidence, note the risk \r\nthat heavy rain could cause the tank to float. Check if the tank de sign (drainage, anchors, pipe \r\nflexibility, surface slab) has been reviewed for projec ted rainfall scenarios. Actually performing a \r\nnew design review is beyond scope of this assessment; this assessment may recommend either \r\nperforming the design review, or a dding backfill on top of the tank to increase burial depth.  \r\n \r\n3.2.12  Drought  \r\nIdentify any equ ipment and structures that rely on minimum water levels for operation. Estimate \r\nthe water level that would degrade performance. Record if the building\'s service lines from  the \r\nwater main contain lead; if they do, the assessment must note that lead concentr ations could \r\nincrease if flow is reduced by water conservation measures.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n15 \r\n \r\n3.2.13  Drainage  \r\nCheck and record the presence of sewage backflow prevention, drains, sumps, grading, and  \r\ncatch basins on site. Review drawings to look for presence of buried components. Ass ess their \r\ncondition and capacity if applicable and accessible. Review maintenance schedules and records.  \r\n \r\n3.2.14  Snow and ice  \r\nIf a flat roof or low -pitch roof is present, search  design and maintenance documents to establish \r\nthe weight capacity of the roof. Engineering calculations are beyond the scope of this \r\nassessment, but may be recommended by this assessment. Search for roof depressions, ceiling \r\nsag, truss sag, drywall cracks , water stains or structural shifts that may indicate past overloading \r\nof the roof. Identify rooftop vents and intakes that may be buried by extreme snowfall and assess \r\npossible failure modes. Assess the c ondition and effectiveness of roof drainage and hea t tracing \r\non roof drains. Review schedules or records of debris clearance from gutters and drains.  \r\nWalk around the facility to look for ground level emergency exits, vents, and intakes that might be \r\nneglec ted by routine snow clearance due to being hidden o r difficult to access.  \r\n \r\n3.2.15  Impingement  \r\nIdentify any exposed assets that may suffer damage in hail, freezing rain, heavy snow \r\naccumulation, high winds carrying debris, or periods of civil unrest. Graffiti and broken windows \r\nare not material to this assessment,  but some statues and antennae may be considered \r\nvulnerable. Document radomes or other protections in place. Watch for soft or porous materials \r\nthat may be vulnerable to erosion.  \r\n \r\n3.2.16  Wind  \r\nVisually inspect the site for insecure equipment, roofing, cladding, gl azing, or other evidence of \r\nwind damage. Use FEMA \"Guidelines for Wind Vulnerability Assessments of Existing Critical \r\nFacilities\", FEMA P -2062, https://www.fe ma.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -07/guidelines -wind-\r\nvulnerability.pdf  as a resource to recognize common wind vulnerabilities, but compliance with this \r\nFEMA document is beyond the scope of this report.  \r\n \r\n3.2.17  Lightning  \r\nAssess features of this property that may be  more prone to receive lightning strikes or more \r\nsusceptible to be damaged by them, for example antennae or trees rising more than 20m above \r\nground level, or solar panels or munition st orage at any height. NFPA 780  Annex L provides \r\ninformation on lightning risk assessment, but compliance with this standard is beyon d the scope \r\nof this report.  \r\n \r\n3.2.18  Condensation  \r\nSearch for evidence of conden sation damage that may be accelerated by a changing climate, or \r\nby increased HVAC operation in response to a changing climate. Document efforts to control \r\ncondensation and assess their effectiveness.  \r\n \r\n3.2.19  Expansion -contraction  \r\nSearch for evidence of freeze -thaw damage, erosion, subsidence or sinkholes that may be \r\naggravated by changing weather conditions. Document measures in place to stabilize damage \r\nand assess their effectiveness. Look for copper domestic water piping or unprotected hydronic \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n16 \r\n \r\npiping that could  burst in a heating outage. Document bowed or cracked foundation walls or other \r\nevidence of expansive clay soils.  \r\n \r\n3.2.20  Biologicals  \r\nRecord any presence of pests, mold,  fungus or unintended plant growth in the building, and \r\nassess the potential for new or increa sed intrusion resulting from a changing climate. Document \r\nmeasures in place to control pests such as mosquito screens and note their condition. The \r\nthreshold of m ateriality varies with the potential health consequences, so known disease carriers \r\nand allerg en producers deserve more scrutiny.  \r\n \r\n3.2.21  History  \r\nInterview staff about building idiosyncrasies and underperformance, search service records, and \r\nlook for evidence of past damage that may indicate any other vulnerability to future disasters. For \r\nexample, ask fo r experiences with overland flooding, sewage backup, water ingress through \r\nfoundations or floor, wind damage, inadequate backup systems or other. Ask staff if the re have \r\nbeen close calls where an incident has nearly occurred. Assess the frequency and durat ion of \r\nutility outages at this location.  \r\n \r\n3.2.22  Summary  \r\nSummarize identified vulnerabilities. Highlight which ones may be of greatest concern, based on \r\ntheir potential impact on building operations and the absence or ineffectiveness of mitigation \r\nmeasure.  \r\n \r\n3.2.23  Robus tness  \r\nAssess the facility\'s ability to support continued operations in the face of disaster. Take an \r\ninventory of features that help make the facility more robust , and note opportunities for \r\nimprovement. The occupant\'s operational robustness is outside the  scope of this assessment.  \r\n \r\n3.2.24  Dependencies  \r\nIdentify all upstream services that the building depends on for continued operation. This will \r\ntypically include but is n ot limited to utilities, transportation routes, garbage collection, IT service \r\ndesk, off -site facilities management, etc. Downstream dependencies should be assessed in the \r\n\"Criticality\" section.  \r\n \r\n3.2.25  Electrical backup  \r\nDescribe electrical back -up systems or redundant feeds, if any. Confirm whether islanded \r\noperation is possible in an outage, and whether  it is automatic or manual. Identify the upstream \r\nservices that back -up generation relies on, for example transportation for propane delivery. \r\nRecord power cap acity of on -site generators and inverters and compare to the building\'s \r\noperational needs. State whether the back -up system only serves essential circuits or the entire \r\nbuilding. If batteries or fuel tanks are present, evaluate the duration of back -up powe r they would \r\nsupport. If back -up generation includes wind or solar, define how back -up duration w ould vary \r\nwith seasonality and weather conditions.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n17 \r\n \r\n3.2.26  Electrical readiness  \r\nReview maintenance and testing records of back -up electrical generators, transfer swit ches, \r\nbatteries and inverters and assess their readiness. Report frequency and results of black s tart \r\ntesting. Interview on -site staff to evaluate the ease of use of start -up and refueling procedures, \r\nsignage, and controls on back -up systems. The purpose o f these interviews is to gauge if backup \r\nperformance might be limited by skillsets normally avail able on -site, in the event that the building \r\nis cut off by simultaneous electrical, transportation, and communication failures, for example in a \r\nsnowstorm or f lood.  \r\n \r\n3.2.27  Communication  \r\nDetermine if internet, phone, or radio connectivity is essential to normal o peration at this location. \r\nDetermine to what extent local communication within the building can continue to operate \r\nindependently if external services are cut. Describe communication back -up systems and \r\nredundant feeds, if any. Describe whether the switchi ng operation to a back -up internet provider \r\nor other communication means is automatic, centralized, or manual by each user. Interview on -\r\nsite staff to eval uate the feasibility of switching to alternative communications in the absence of IT \r\nsupport, for exa mple if IT is overwhelmed by City -wide communication failures. If back -up \r\nsystems rely on short range radios, assess their coverage and clarity given obstr uctions and radio \r\ninterference on site. Resilience of IT servers is beyond the scope of this assessme nt. \r\n \r\n3.2.28  Lightning  \r\nIf any lightning vulnerabilities have been identified, or if the building is taller than 20m, assess the \r\ncondition and functionality of ligh tning protection systems, grounding systems, equipotential \r\nbonding, gas discharge tubes, and permanen tly installed surge protection devices. Ignore plug -in \r\npower bars. Visually inspect for loose connection, fasteners, or indications of damage. Review \r\nmaint enance records for compliance with NFPA 780  Annex D, \"Inspection and Maintenance of \r\nLightning Protection systems\". Recommend any co ntinuity tests, ground resistance tests, or \r\ntightening of clamps and splicers that seem to have been neglected by regular maintenance. \r\nDocument the presence of lightnin g protection for trees and conformance with NFPA 780 Annex \r\nF, \"Protection for Trees\".  \r\n \r\n3.2.29  Water \r\nAssess the building\'s capacity to operate during interruptions, degradation, or rationing of wat er \r\nsupplies. Record the p resence of low -flush toilets, graywater systems, rainwater collection, \r\nstorage tanks, and equipment to boil and filter water.  \r\n \r\n3.2.30  Transportation  \r\nAssess the diversity and redundancy of routes and modes of transportation by which staff , clients, \r\nsupplies and fuel can access the building. Describe the building\'s response to historical \r\nsnowstorms and mass transit suspensions, and define an y disruptions to the City\'s services to the \r\npublic that resulted from these events.  \r\n \r\n3.2.31  Security  \r\nEvaluat e whether this facility has unusual security needs that may be susceptible to climate \r\ndisruptions. Most City facilities have low security needs, and further evaluation is not necessary. \r\nHowever, if the facility houses jails, weapon lockers, high value targ ets, or terrorism \r\nvulnerabilities, an assessment of security resilience may be warranted. In this case, flag possible \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n18 \r\n \r\nconsiderations for a security r esilience assessment, but refrain from documenting any security \r\nmeasures or vulnerabilities that may be con sidered secret.  \r\n \r\n3.2.32  Other  \r\nAssess the building\'s capacity to support City operations during disruptions of any other upstream \r\nservices.  \r\n \r\n3.2.33  Adaptability  \r\nAssess the site\'s physical flexibility to absorb new lessons that can be drawn from a catastrophe.  \r\n \r\n3.2.34  Space capa city \r\nEvaluate how much extra space and occupant capacity is available for expansion of operations, \r\nor absorption of other operations. This report assesses the building and property only; staffing \r\nlevels are beyond the scope of this report.  \r\n \r\n3.2.35  Utility capacit y \r\nQuantify the margin by which electrical, natural gas, water, communications and other service \r\ncapacities exceed peak demand, and which co uld be made available to expanded or absorbed \r\noperations.  \r\n \r\n3.2.36  Institutional memory  \r\nRefresh conclusions from past resilie nce assessments. Comment on the availability of \r\ndocumentation to support analysis of resilience of this site.  \r\n \r\n3.2.37  Reconfiguration  \r\nAssess the e ase of reconfiguration of the building. Open -concept spaces, movable partitions, \r\nwireless communications and overhead  cranes offer flexibility, while fixed walls and tethered \r\ncommunications hamper it.  \r\n \r\n3.2.38  Repurposing  \r\nIdentify spaces that could be or have been  repurposed temporarily during disasters, for example \r\nas cooling centres, warming centres, or emergency shelters.  \r\n \r\n3.2.39  Blackout  \r\nAssess the building\'s capacity to operate in the complete absence of electricity, assuming \r\nelectrical back -up systems are inoperable. Note accessibility features, sump pumps and life \r\nsafety systems that depend on electricity. Note the presence of op erable windows, daylighting, \r\naccessibility ramps, portable heaters, etc., and define the portion of the year, times of day, and \r\nweather conditions where the building could continue to support some or all of the services \r\nnormally provided at that location.  \r\n \r\n3.2.40  Communication  \r\nAssess the diversity of communication tools available on site. Note tools that can operate in full \r\nblackout condit ions, such as whiteboards, bulletin boards and battery -powered radio systems.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n19 \r\n \r\n3.2.41  Lessons learned  \r\nDocument innovative solutions th at have been trialed at this site in past disasters and assess \r\ntheir effectiveness.  \r\n \r\n3.2.42  Rapid Recovery  \r\nAsses the delays and costs to return this facility\'s operations back to normal as rapidly as \r\npossible following a disaster. Estimate the overall value in ea ch category, but further breakdown \r\nof capital assets is not needed.  \r\n \r\n3.2.43  Expendable  \r\nExpendable assets a re assets which are not essential to city services, or which could be \r\nabandoned and rebuilt without urgency before city services to the public are impacted.  For \r\nexample, staff break rooms, ordinary decorations, and parking spaces may be expendable, but \r\nhockey arenas are not. Estimate the cost of eventually replacing expendable assets. Budgetary \r\ncapacity to absorb this cost is not material to this classificati on. \r\n \r\n3.2.44  Mobile  \r\nMobile assets are assets normally stationed at this location which are not expendable bu t could \r\nbe relocated and returned to operation on short notice. The relevant triggers are flood warnings, \r\nfire behaviour predictions, police advisories, etc . where sufficient notice would be available to \r\nrelocate assets without risk to human safety. For ex ample, vehicles, office computers and \r\npaintings may be mobile. Estimate the cost of relocating all mobile assets. Provide photos of \r\nobstructions in the buil ding layout that would impede relocation.  \r\n \r\n3.2.45  Replaceable  \r\nReplaceable assets are assets which are neith er expendable nor mobile but are sufficiently \r\ngeneric that they could quickly be replaced by equivalent private sector rentals. For example, \r\noffice floorspa ce, kitchens, and electric car chargers may be replaceable. Categorizing an asset \r\nas replaceable doe s depend on a judgement of whether private sector capacity is ample enough \r\nto remain adequate following a City -wide disaster, but a detailed analysis of Cit y-wide capacity is \r\nbeyond the scope of this assessment. Estimate the monthly rental cost to substitu te all \r\nreplaceable assets.  \r\n \r\n3.2.46  Fixed  \r\nFixed assets are assets which are essential to city services, cannot be relocated on short notice, \r\nand are too specialized  to replace with private sector rentals. For example, communication \r\ntowers, overhead cranes, and her itage architecture may be fixed. Estimate the cost and time to \r\nreplace fixed assets, or identify unique features which could never be replaced. Describe and  \r\nassess the effectiveness of any protection measures present that may help mitigate damage after \r\nan evacuation. Assess the feasibility, preparedness, and effectiveness of deploying \r\nsupplementary protection on short notice, for example by stacking sandbags,  boarding up \r\nwindows, draining pipes, or shrouding trees.  \r\n \r\n3.2.47  Reparability  \r\nDiscuss any features that ma y make the facility unusually difficult to repair. This may include \r\ndifficult access for large equipment replacement, obsolete refrigerants, or hazardous bu ilding \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n20 \r\n \r\nmaterials. Suggest spares stockpiles or material handling equipment that could be kept on han d \r\nto enable rapid recovery.  \r\n \r\n3.2.48  Summary  \r\nProvide a table summarizing the value of expendable and fixed assets, the cost of relocating \r\nmobile assets, and the mon thly recurring cost of replaceable assets in response to a disaster that \r\ndisables this building. Summarize plausible supplementary protection measures that could be \r\ndeployed on short notice.  \r\n \r\n3.2.49  Criticality  \r\nAssess the impact of an unexpected loss of the build ing and the material assets it contains.  \r\n \r\n3.2.50  Disaster functions  \r\nAssess whether an unexpect ed evacuation of this location in the midst of an ongoing wide -area \r\ndisaster (e.g. flood, firestorm, civil unrest, etc.) would immediately weaken disaster response. \r\nCons ider that temporary disaster functions at this location, such as cooling centres or eme rgency \r\nshelters in repurposed space, would be suspended. If a limited duration evacuation or partial \r\ndegradation of services could be tolerated without aggravating the d isaster, define the conditions \r\nand durations that could be tolerated.  \r\n \r\n3.2.51  Redundancy  \r\nIdentify nearby facilities that normally offer the same services. For example, if the site is an arena, \r\nidentify nearby arenas. If the site is repurposed during some disaste r scenarios, for example as \r\ncooling centres or emergency shelters, ident ify nearby alternatives for these services as well. \r\nEvaluating whether facilities have any extra operational capacity to allow redistribution of load is \r\nbeyond the scope of this assess ment.  \r\n \r\n3.2.52  Uniqueness  \r\nIdentify any irreplaceably unique assets at this locat ion. This could potentially include heritage \r\narchitecture, works of art, historic sites, non -redundant archives, science missions, or highly \r\nspecialized facilities that have no plausib le redundancy options. Describe the asset\'s importance \r\nto the City\'s cul ture and economy. Unique functions that do not rely on unique assets are \r\npresumed to be relocatable and do not factor in an assessment of criticality.  \r\n \r\n3.2.53  Contamination  \r\nAssess the potenti al for hazardous fluids on site to contaminate water during a flood, to \r\naccelerate a wide -area fire that consumes the building, or to contaminate land, air or water in the \r\nevent of building damage. Handheld consumables are generally not material to this as sessment, \r\nunless extraordinarily hazardous or present in bulk quantities . Potential spills of HVAC refrigerant, \r\nhydronic antifreeze, natural gas or sewage, or pre -existing soil contamination that could be \r\nmobilized by changing groundwater conditions or unp recedented soil temperature conditions may \r\nbe material to this assessmen t. Quantify potential contamination where possible. Note the height \r\nat which materials are stored. Document the presence and condition of spill guards, multi -layer \r\ncontainment, excess flow valves, backflow preventers, and fireproofing.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n21 \r\n \r\n3.2.54  Debris  \r\nAssess the p otential for the site to produce hazardous debris that could fall, roll over or be carried \r\naway in a flood or windstorm and aggravate structural damage elsewhere or pose safety threats . \r\nEstimate the potential spread of asbestos and lead paint debris from b uilding damage.  \r\n \r\n3.2.55  Summary  \r\nSummarize, in concise and objective language, the critical consequences of strategically \r\nabandoning the site in the midst of a City -wide disaster. The summary  should be sufficiently clear, \r\ncomplete, and easy to read to enable rapi d decisions under pressure.  \r\n \r\n3.2.56  Resilience upgrades  \r\nPropose sensible precautions to prepare for a more difficult climate. This may include measures \r\nthat reduce vulnerability or criticali ty of the building or improve its robustness, adaptability, \r\nresourcefulness, or rapid recovery potential. Provide a list of measures considered, but felt to be \r\nimpractical, with brief reasons for rejection.  \r\n \r\n3.2.57  Electrical backup  \r\nRecognizing that electricity i s often the most fragile service essential to operations, re commend \r\nbackup options.  \r\n \r\n3.2.58  Hidden vulnerabilities  \r\nIf disassembly, testing, borescope examination, or other specialized inspection would be \r\nadvisable to fully assess vulnerabilities or the effective ness of backup measures, describe the \r\npotential defects that  such an inspection might expose. Recommend suitable inspection \r\nprocedures, standards and personnel qualifications that could provide definitive confirmation.  \r\n \r\n3.2.59  Cost estimates  \r\nResilience recommend ations costing more than $5,000 should include estimates of capital cost, \r\noperational costs, consequences of inaction, and frequency of threat to enable decision making \r\nregarding which resilience measures should be implemented.  \r\nWhere possible, provide a fi nancial analysis showing probability -weighted simple payback period \r\nfor the resilience measures. If the value of a resilience measure depends on a low probability \r\ndisaster then financial analysis is beyond the scope of this assessment. Also, if the asset i s part \r\nof a redundant net work across the City, for example one of many fire halls, then the financial \r\nanalysis is also beyond the scope of this assessment. In these cases where financial analysis is \r\nnot done, provide a qualitative evaluation of priority ba sed on existing vulnerabi lity and criticality.  \r\nIdentify potential incentive funds for resilience measures, such as the Disaster Mitigation and \r\nAdaptation Fund.  \r\nEstimate the impact of each measure on building operations and maintenance procedures during \r\nthe intervals between disast ers. \r\nIf climate change is likely to shorten the building\'s useful life in the absence of any resilience \r\nupgrades, predict the likely failure mode(s) and estimate remaining life if no resilience upgrades \r\nare implemented.  \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n \r\n22 \r\n \r\n3.2.60  Emergency planning  \r\nEmergency planni ng is beyond the scope of this report. Assume that existing emergency plans \r\nremain adequate for immediate response to emergencies, that life safety is ensured, and that \r\noperations have the capacity to absorb limited material losses . The purpose of this res ilience \r\nassessment is to support the continuity of City operations in spite of increasingly frequent \r\ndisruptions from climate change.  \r\n \r\n3.3 Summary of Deliverables  \r\nThe consultant will produce the following deliverables:  \r\na) Net Zero study summary report  \r\nb) Solar PV design software report  \r\nc) Ground heat exchanger design software report  \r\nd) Energy modelling simulation files for each of the four scenarios  \r\ne) A financial analysis spreadsheet comparing the four scenarios  \r\nf) One-page business case for net ze ro emission scenario  \r\ng) Climate Change Resilience Assessment report  \r\nBoth reports must be submitted in \"draft\" form to City of Toronto Project Manager and \r\ncirculated to the CREM staff for review.
