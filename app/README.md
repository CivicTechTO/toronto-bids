# Toronto Bids Application

This folder contains an Angular webapp that's a rough start for something we might want to use as a front end to access bid data.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, ensure your machine meets the following prerequisites (these are all just the prereqs to run a standard Angular App)


- Install NodeJS and the Node Package Manager on the machine this is running on (https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Download the Angular CLI, instructions found here - (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Building the webapp

- If this is your first time running the webapp, make sure that you have NodeJS, npm and the Angular CLI installed on your machine. 
  
- Open a terminal in this folder and run ```npm install```. This will ensure download all of the dependencies that you need to run this project into a folder called 'node_modules'. 

- Run the command `ng serve`. This will stand up a webserver that the app will be accessible on for local access. By default the webserver will run on port 4200, but you can change this by supplying the `--port` parameter when you invoke `ng serve`.
